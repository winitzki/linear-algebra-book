Preface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a first course of linear algebra, one learns the various uses of matrices,
 for instance the properties of determinants, eigenvectors and eigenvalues,
 and methods for solving linear equations.
 The required calculations are straightforward (because, conceptually, vectors
 and matrices are merely 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

arrays of numbers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) if cumbersome.
 However, there is a more abstract and more powerful approach: Vectors are
 elements of abstract vector spaces, and matrices represent linear transformatio
ns of vectors.
 This 
\series bold
invariant
\series default
 or 
\series bold
coordinate-free
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{coordinate-free approach}

\end_inset

 approach is important in algebra and has found many applications in science.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The purpose of this book is to help the reader make a transition to the
 abstract coordinate-free approach, and also to give a hands-on introduction
 to exterior products, a powerful tool of linear algebra.
 I show how the coordin\SpecialChar \-
ate-free approach together with exterior products
 can be used to clarify the basic results of matrix algebra, at the same
 time avoiding all the laborious matrix calculations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here is a simple theorem that illustrates the advantages of the exterior
 product approach.
 A triangle is oriented arbitrarily in three-dim\SpecialChar \-
en\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al space; the three
 orthogonal projections of this triangle are triangles in the three coordinate
 planes.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 be the area of the initial triangle, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B,C$
\end_inset

 be the areas of the three projections.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S^{2}=A^{2}+B^{2}+C^{2}.\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
Proving this statement directly via elementary geometry appears daunting,
 for instance, because of the arbitrary orientation of the triangle in space.
 -- Actually not: 
\begin_inset Formula $A=S\cos\alpha$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the angle between the 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 axis and the vector normal to 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

; then use the Pythagoras theorem.
 But this proof cannot be easily generalized to 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-dimensional parallelepipeds in 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 dimensions.
 - Thanks to Alexander Shen for this remark.
\end_layout

\end_inset

If one uses bivectors to represent the oriented areas of the triangle and
 of its three projections, the statement above is equivalent to the Pythagoras
 theorem in the space of bivectors, and the proof requires only a few straightfo
rward definitions and checks.
 A generalization of this result to volumes of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-dim\SpecialChar \-
en\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al bodies embedded in 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dim\SpecialChar \-
en\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al spaces is then obtained with no extra work.
 I hope that the readers will appreciate the beauty of an approach to linear
 algebra that allows us to obtain such results quickly and almost without
 calculations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exterior product is widely used in connection with 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-forms, which are exterior products of

.
 In this book I do not use 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-forms --- instead I use vectors, 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-vectors, and their exterior products.
 This approach allows a more straightforward geometric interpretation and
 also simplifies calculations and proofs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make the book logically self-contained, I present a proof of every basic
 result of linear algebra.
 The emphasis is not on computational techniques, although the coordinate-free

\end_layout

\end_inset

 The main topics covered are tensor products; exterior products; coordinate-free
 definitions of the determinant 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, the trace 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Tr}\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, and the characteristic polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\hat{A}}\left(\lambda\right)$
\end_inset

; basic properties of determinants; solution of linear equations, including
 over-determined or under-determined systems, using Kramer's rule; the Liouville
 formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\exp\hat{A}=\exp\textrm{Tr}\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 as an identity of formal series; the algebraic complement (cofactor) matrix;
 Jacobi's formula for the variation of the determinant; variation of the
 characteristic polynomial and of eigenvalue; the Cayley-Hamilton theorem;
 analytic functions of operators; Jordan canonical form; construction of
 projectors onto Jordan cells; Hodge star and the computation of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-dimensional volumes through 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-vectors; definition and properties of the Pfaffian 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Pf}\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 for antisymmetric operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 All these standard results are derived without matrix calculations; instead,
 the exterior product is used as a main computational tool.

 logically motivated presentation aimed at students.
 Therefore, some exercises with hints and partial solutions are included,
 but not references to literature.
\begin_inset Foot

\begin_layout Standard
The approach to determinants via exterior products has been known since
 at least 1880 but does not seem especially popular in textbooks, perhaps
 due to the somewhat abstract nature of the tensor product.
 I believe that this approach to determinants and to other results in linear
 algebra deserves to be more widely appreciated.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 I have tried to avoid being overly pedantic while keeping the exposition
 mathematically rigorous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sections marked with a star 
\begin_inset Formula $^{*}$
\end_inset

 are not especially difficult but contain material that may be skipped at
 first reading.
 (Exercises marked with a star 
\emph on
are

 more difficult.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first chapter is an introduction to the invariant approach to vector
 spaces.
 I assume that readers are familiar with elementary linear algebra in the
 language of row/column vectors and matrices; Appendix\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sec:Matrices}

\end_inset

 contains a brief overview of that material.

Abstract vector spaces are developed as a generalization of the familiar

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Three-dimen\SpecialChar \-

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us begin with something you already know.
 Three-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al vectors are specified by triples of coordinates, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}\equiv\left(x,y,z\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The operations of 
\series bold
vector sum
\series default
 and 
\series bold
vector product
\series default
 of such vectors are defined by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\left(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1}\right)+\left(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2}\right) & \equiv\left(x_{1}+x_{2},y_{1}+y_{2},z_{1}+z_{2}\right);\label{eq:3d sum}\\
\left(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1}\right)\times\left(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2}\right) & \equiv(y_{1}z_{2}-z_{1}y_{2},\, z_{1}x_{2}-x_{1}z_{2},\nonumber \\
 & x_{1}y_{2}-y_{1}x_{2}).\label{eq:3d vector product}\end{align}

\end_inset

(I assume that these definitions are familiar to you.) Vectors can be 
\series bold
rescaled
\series default
 by multiplying them with real numbers, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
c\mathbf{r}=c\left(x,y,z\right)\equiv\left(cx,cy,cz\right).\label{eq:3d scalar mult}\end{equation}

\end_inset

A rescaled vector is parallel to the original vector and points either in
 the same or in the opposite direction.
 In addition, a 
\series bold
scalar product
\series default
 of two vectors is defined,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left(x_{1},y_{1},z_{1}\right)\cdot\left(x_{2},y_{2},z_{2}\right)\equiv x_{1}x_{2}+y_{1}y_{2}+z_{1}z_{2}.\label{eq:3d scalar prod}\end{equation}

\end_inset

These operations encapsulate all of Euclidean geometry in a purely algebraic
 language.
 For example, the 
\series bold
length
\series default
 of a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left|\mathbf{r}\right|\equiv\sqrt{\mathbf{r}\cdot\mathbf{r}}=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}},\label{eq:r modulus}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 the 
\series bold
angle
\series default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 between vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}_{2}$
\end_inset

 is found from the relation (the cosine theorem)
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\mathbf{r}_{1}\right|\left|\mathbf{r}_{2}\right|\cos\alpha=\mathbf{r}_{1}\cdot\mathbf{r}_{2},\]

\end_inset

while the 
\series bold
area
\series default
 of a triangle spanned by vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}_{2}$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \[
S=\frac{1}{2}\left|\mathbf{r}_{1}\times\mathbf{r}_{2}\right|.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using these definitions, one can reformulate every geometric statement (such
 as, 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a triangle having two equal sides has also two equal angles
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

) in terms of relations between vectors, which are ultimately reducible
 to algebraic equations involving a set of numbers.
 The replacement of geometric constructions by algebraic relations is useful
 because it allows us to free ourselves from the confines of our three-dimension
al intuition; we are then able to solve problems in higher-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al spaces.
 The price is a greater complication of the algebraic equations and inequalities
 that need to be solved.
 To make these equations more transparent and easier to handle, the theory
 of linear algebra is developed.
 The first step is to realize what features of vectors are essential and
 what are just accidental facts of our familiar three-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-

 space.

\begin_layout Subsection
From three-dimen\SpecialChar \-

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Abstract vector spaces retain the essential properties of the familiar Euclidean

 not 3 but  an arbitrary integer number (or even  infinity); second, the
 coordinates are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

abstract numbers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (see below) instead of real numbers.
 Let us first pass to higher-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al vectors.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generalizing the notion of a three-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al vector to a higher (still
 finite) dimension is straightforward: instead of triples 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x,y,z\right)$
\end_inset

 one considers sets of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{1},...,x_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The definitions of the vector sum\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:3d sum}

\end_inset

), scaling\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:3d scalar mult}

(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:3d scalar prod}

\end_inset

-tuples of coordinates.
 In this way we can describe 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimen\SpecialChar \-

 All theorems of linear algebra are proved in the same way regardless of
 the number of components in vectors, so the generalization to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimen\SpecialChar \-

\end_inset

but what about the vector product? The formula\InsetSpace ~

A vector product exists only in some cases, e.g.\InsetSpace ~

 This is a theorem of higher algebra which we will not prove here.
\end_layout

 At this point we will not require the vector spaces to have either a vector

 properties of vectors.
 Later we will see that there is an algebraic construction (the exterior

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Examples of number fields
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Real numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 are a field, as are rational numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset

 and complex numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

, with all arithmetic operations defined as usual.
 Integer numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Z}$
\end_inset

 with the usual arithmetic are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 a field because e.g.\InsetSpace ~
the division of 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 by a nonzero number 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 cannot be an integer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another interesting example is the set of numbers of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $a+b\sqrt{3}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b\in\mathbb{Q}$
\end_inset

 are 
\emph on
rational
\emph default
 numbers.
 It is easy to see that sums, products, and ratios of such numbers are again
 numbers from the same set, for example
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & (a_{1}+b_{1}\sqrt{3})(a_{2}+b_{2}\sqrt{3})\\
 & =\left(a_{1}a_{2}+3b_{1}b_{2}\right)+\left(a_{1}b_{2}+a_{2}b_{1}\right)\sqrt{3}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

 Let's check the division property:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{a+b\sqrt{3}}=\frac{a-b\sqrt{3}}{a-b\sqrt{3}}\frac{1}{a+b\sqrt{3}}=\frac{a-b\sqrt{3}}{a^{2}-3b^{2}}.\]

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{3}$
\end_inset

 is irrational, so the denominator 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{2}-3b^{2}$
\end_inset

 is never zero as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 are rational and at least one of 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

 is nonzero.
 Therefore, we can divide numbers of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $a+b\sqrt{3}$
\end_inset

 and again get numbers of the same kind.
 It follows that the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a+b\sqrt{3}\,|\, a,b\in\mathbb{Q}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is indeed a number field.
 This field is usually denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{3}]$
\end_inset

 and called an extension of rational numbers by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Fields of this form are useful in algebraic number theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A field might even consist of a 
\emph on
finite
\emph default
 set of numbers (in which case it is called a 
\series bold
finite field
\series default
).
 For example, the set of three numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1,2\right\} $
\end_inset

 can be made a field if we define the arithmetic operations as
\begin_inset Formula \[
1+2\equiv0,\,2+2\equiv1,\,2*2\equiv1,\,1/2\equiv2,\]

\end_inset

with all other operations as in usual arithmetic.
 This is the field of integers modulo 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 and is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 Fields of this form are useful, for instance, in cryptography.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any field must contain elements that play the role of the numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

; we denote these elements simply by 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the smallest possible field is the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 0,1\right\} $
\end_inset

 with the usual relations 
\begin_inset Formula $0+1=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $1\cdot1=1$
\end_inset

 etc.
 This field is denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{F}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Most of the time we will not need to specify the number field; it is all
 right to imagine that we always use 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

Question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I do not understand how to work with abstract vectors in abstract vector
 spaces.
 According to the vector space axioms (definition V2), I should be able
 to add vectors together and multiply them by scalars.
 It is clear how to add the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-tuples 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(v_{1},...,v_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

, but how can I compute anything with an abstract vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 that does not seem to have any components? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Definition V2 is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

abstract
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 in the sense that it does not explain 
\emph on
how
\emph default
 to add particular kinds of vectors, instead it merely lists the set of
 properties 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 vector space must satisfy.
 To define a 
\emph on
particular
\emph default
 vector space, we of course need to specify a particular set of vectors
 and a rule for adding its elements in an explicit fashion (see examples
 below in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Examples-of-vector}

\end_inset

).
 Definition V2 is used in the following way: Suppose someone claims that
 a certain set 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 of particular mathematical objects is a vector space over some number field,
 then we only need to check that the sum of vectors and the multiplication
 of vector by a number are well-defined and conform to the properties listed
 in Definition V2.
 If every property holds, then the set 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is a vector space, and all the theorems of linear algebra will automatically
 hold for the elements of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 Viewed from this perspective, Definition V1 specifies a 
\emph on
particular
\emph default
 vector space---the space of rows of numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $(v_{1},...,v_{n})$
\end_inset

.
 In some cases the vector space at hand is exactly that of Definition V1,
 and then it is convenient to work with components 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 when performing calculations with specific vectors.
 However, components are not needed for proving general theorems.
 In this book, when I say that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 is given,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 I imagine that enough concrete information about 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 will be available when it is actually needed.

\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}\right)$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the set of all three-dimen\SpecialChar \-

al vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 which are orthogonal to a given vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\neq0$
\end_inset

; here we use the standard scalar product\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:3d scalar prod}

\end_inset

); vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 are called 
\series bold
orthogonal to each other
\series default
 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{b}=0$
\end_inset

.
 This set is closed under vector sum and scalar multiplication because if
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{a}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{a}=0$
\end_inset

, then for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{u}+\lambda\mathbf{v}\right)\cdot\mathbf{a}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we obtain a vector space (a certain subset of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

) which is defined not in terms of components but through geometric relations
 between vectors of another (previously defined) space.

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the set of all real-valued continuous functions

 and such that 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(0\right)=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(1\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 This set is a vector space over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 Indeed, the definition of a vector space is satisfied if we define the
 sum of two functions as 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)+f\left(y\right)$
\end_inset

 and the multiplication by scalars, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda f\left(x\right)$

 It is easy to see that the axioms of the vector space are satisfied: If
 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(x\right)=f\left(x\right)+\lambda g\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $f\left(x\right)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $g\left(x\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $\left[0,1\right]$
\end_inset

 and satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $h\left(0\right)=h\left(1\right)=0$

the function

 The operations of sum and scalar multiplication are defined in the natural

For the purpose of manipulating such expressions, it is unimportant that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$

meaningless symbols
\begin_inset Quotes erd

?

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Usually when we write 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $a+b$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 we imply that the operation 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

+
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is already defined, so 
\begin_inset Formula $a+b$
\end_inset

 is another number if 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 are numbers.
 However, in the case of formal expressions described in Example\InsetSpace ~
4, the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

+
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 sign is actually going to acquire a 
\emph on
new
\emph default
 definition.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}+\mathbf{Y}$
\end_inset

 is not equal to a new symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Z}$
\end_inset

, instead 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}+\mathbf{Y}$
\end_inset

 is just 
\emph on
an expression
\emph default
 that we can manipulate.
 Consider the analogy with complex numbers: the number 
\begin_inset Formula $1+2\text{i}$
\end_inset

 is an expression that we manipulate, and the imaginary unit, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{i}$
\end_inset

, is a symbol that is never 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

equal to something else.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 According to its definition, the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}+\mathbf{Y}$
\end_inset

 cannot be simplified to anything else, just like 
\begin_inset Formula $1+2\text{i}$
\end_inset

 cannot be simplified.
 The symbols 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{i}$
\end_inset

 are 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 meaningless: their meaning comes 
\emph on
from
\emph default
 
\emph on
the
\emph default
 
\emph on

\emph default
 
\emph on

\emph on

 with these symbols.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Maybe it helps to change notation.
 Let us begin by writing a pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,b\right)$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $a\mathbf{X}+b\mathbf{Y}$
\end_inset

.
 We can define the sum of such pairs in the natural way, e.g.
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(2,3\right)+\left(-2,1\right)=\left(0,4\right).\]

\end_inset

It is clear that these pairs build a vector space.
 Now, to remind ourselves that the numbers of the pair stand for, say, quantitie
s of water and oil, we write 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(2\mathbf{X},3\mathbf{Y}\right)$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(2,3\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The symbols 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Y}$
\end_inset

 are merely part of the notation.
 Now it is natural to change the notation further and to write simply 
\begin_inset Formula $2\mathbf{X}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(2\mathbf{X},0\mathbf{Y}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a\mathbf{X}+b\mathbf{Y}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a\mathbf{X},b\mathbf{Y}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 It is clear that we do not introduce anything new when we write 
\begin_inset Formula $a\mathbf{X}+b\mathbf{Y}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a\mathbf{X},b\mathbf{Y}\right)$
\end_inset

: We merely change the notation so that computations appear easier.
 Similarly, complex numbers can be understood as pairs of real numbers,
 such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(3,2\right)$
\end_inset

, for which 
\begin_inset Formula $3+2\text{i}$
\end_inset

 is merely a more convenient notation that helps remember the rules of computati
on.

Question: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All these abstract definitions notwithstanding, would it be all right if
 I always keep in the back of my mind that a vector 
\series bold

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset


\series default
 is a row of components 
\begin_inset Formula $(v_{1},...,v_{n})$
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It will be perfectly all right 
\emph on
as long as
\emph default
 you work with 
\emph on
finite
\emph default
-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al vector spaces.
 (This intuition often fails when working with infinite-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al spaces!)
 Even if all we need is finite-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al vectors, there is another argument
 in favor of the coordinate-free thinking.
 Suppose I persist in visualizing vectors as rows 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(v_{1},...,v_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

; let us see what happens.
 First, I introduce the vector notation and write 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(u_{1}+v_{1},...,u_{n}+v_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

; this is just for convenience and to save time.
 Then I check the axioms of the vector space (see the definition V2 above);
 row vectors of course obey these axioms.
 Suppose I somehow manage to produce all proofs and calculations using only
 the vector notation and the axioms of the abstract vector space, and suppose
 I never use the coordinates 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}$
\end_inset

 explicitly, even though I keep them in the back of my mind.
 Then all my results will be valid not only for collections of components
 
\begin_inset Formula $(v_{1},...,v_{n})$
\end_inset

 but also for 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 mathematical objects that obey the axioms of the abstract vector space.
 In fact I would then realize that I have been working with abstract vectors
 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 
\emph on
along
\emph default
 while carrying the image of a row vector 
\begin_inset Formula $(v_{1},...,v_{n})$

 in the back of my mind.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Unlike the definition V1, the definition V2 does not include any information
 about the dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
ality of the vector space.
 So, on the one hand, this definition treats finite- and infinite-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-

 spaces on the same footing; the definition V2 lets us establish that a
 certain set is a vector space without knowing its dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
ality in advance.
 On the other hand, once a particular vector space is given, we may need
 some additional work to figure out the number of dimensions in it.
 The key notion used for that purpose is

linear independence.

\begin_layout Standard

 constitute a 
\series bold

\series bold
set
\series default
.
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{linearly (in)dependent set}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Interpretation:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a first example, consider the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}\right\} $
\end_inset

 consisting of a single nonzero vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 The set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a linearly independent set because 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

 only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

.
 Now consider the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\right\} $
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}=2\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

 is any vector.
 This set is linearly dependent because there exists a nontrivial linear
 combination (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
a linear combination with 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 nonzero coefficients) which is equal to zero, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}-2\mathbf{v}=1\mathbf{u}+\left(-2\right)\mathbf{v}+0\mathbf{w}=0.\]

\end_inset

More generally: If a set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly dependent, then there exists at least one vector equal to a
 linear combination of other vectors.
 Indeed, by definition there must be at least one nonzero number among the
 numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 involved in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:linear dependence}

\end_inset

); suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}\neq0$
\end_inset

, then we can divide Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:linear dependence}

\end_inset

) by 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

 and express 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 through other vectors, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{1}=-\frac{1}{\lambda_{1}}\left(\lambda_{2}\mathbf{v}_{2}+...+\lambda_{n}\mathbf{v}_{n}\right).\]

\end_inset

In other words, the existence of numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

, not all equal to zero, is indeed the formal statement of the idea that
 at least some vector in the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a linear combination of other vectors.
 By writing a linear combination 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{v}_{i}=0$
\end_inset

 and by saying that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

not all 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 are zero
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 we avoid specifying 
\emph on
which
\emph default
 vector is equal to a linear combination of others.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Often instead of saying 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a linearly independent 
\emph on

\emph default

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 one says 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

a set of linearly independent 
\emph on

\emph default
.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 This is intended to mean the same thing but might be confusing because,
 taken literally, the phrase 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

a set of independent vectors
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means a set in which each vector is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

independent
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by itself.
 Keep in mind that linear independence is a property of a 
\emph on
set
\emph default
 
\emph on
of vectors
\emph default
; this property depends on the relationships between all the vectors in
 the set and is not a property of each vector taken separately.
 It would be more consistent to say e.g.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Quotes eld

a set of 
\emph on
mutually
\emph default
 independent vectors.
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 Is the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right\} $

 linearly independent? Suppose there exists a linear combination 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\mathbf{a}+\beta\mathbf{b}=0$

 with at least one of 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\beta\neq0$

\alpha\mathbf{a}+\beta\mathbf{b}=\left(0,\alpha\right)+\left(\beta,\beta\right)=\left(\beta,\alpha+\beta\right){\lyxbuildrel!\above=}\,0.\]

\end_inset

This is possible only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=0$

Proof:

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
(1)
\series default
 By definition of dimension, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{v},\mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{n}\}$
\end_inset

 must be linearly 
\emph on

\emph default
.
 By definition of linear dependence, there exist numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

, not all equal to zero, such that
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\lambda_{0}\mathbf{v}+\lambda_{1}\mathbf{e}_{1}+...+\lambda_{n}\mathbf{e}_{n}=0.\label{eq:v expr}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Now if we had 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}=0$
\end_inset

, it would mean that not all numbers in the smaller set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \lambda_{1},...,\lambda_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are zero; however, in that case Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:v expr}

\end_inset

) would contradict the linear independence of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}\neq0$
\end_inset

 and Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:v expr}

\end_inset

) shows that the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed through the basis, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}v_{k}\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

 with the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}\equiv-\lambda_{k}/\lambda_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
(2)
\series default
 To show that the set of coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ v_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is unique, we assume that there are two such sets, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ v_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ v_{k}^{\prime}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}v_{k}\mathbf{e}_{k}-\sum_{k=1}^{n}v_{k}^{\prime}\mathbf{e}_{k}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\left(v_{k}-v_{k}^{\prime}\right)\mathbf{e}_{k}.\]

\end_inset

Since the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent, all coefficients in this linear combination must
 vanish, so 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}=v_{k}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

For many purposes it is better to think about a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 not as a set of its components 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ v_{1},...,v_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in some basis, but as a geometric object; a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

directed magnitude
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is a useful heuristic idea.
 Geometric objects exist in the vector space independently of a choice of
 basis.
 In linear algebra, one is typically interested in problems involving relations
 between vectors, for example 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}=a\mathbf{v}+b\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b\in\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 are numbers.
 No choice of basis is necessary to describe such relations between vectors;
 I will call such relations

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{coordinate-free approach}

\end_inset

 or 
\series bold
geometric
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{geometric relation}

\end_inset

.
 As I will demonstrate later in this text, many statements of linear algebra
 are more transparent and easier to prove in the coordinate-free language.
 Of course, in many practical applications one absolutely needs to perform
 specific calculations with components in an appropriately chosen basis,
 and facility with such calculations is important.
 But I find it helpful to keep a coordinate-free (geometric) picture in
 the back of my mind even when I am doing calculations in coordinates.

Question:

\begin_layout Standard
I am not sure how to determine the number of dimensions in a vector space.
 According to the definition, I should figure out whether there exist certain
 linearly independent sets of vectors.
 But surely it is impossible to go over all sets of

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course it is impossible when there are infinitely many vectors.
 This is simply not the way to go.
 We can determine the dimen\SpecialChar \-

proving

 that the space has a basis consisting of a certain number of vectors.
 A particular vector space must be specified in concrete terms (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Examples-of-vector}

 that covers all sets of

 vectors at once.

 The set

\begin_layout Standard
The space

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $ax+by+cz=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c$
\end_inset

 is nonzero.
 Suppose, without loss of generality, that 
\begin_inset Formula $a\neq0$
\end_inset

; then we can express 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x=-\frac{b}{a}y-\frac{c}{a}z.\]

\end_inset

Now the two parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 are arbitrary while 
\begin_inset Formula $x$

 is determined.
 Hence it appears plausible that the space

\end_inset

 is

 Let us prove this formally.
 Choose as the possible basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}=(-\frac{b}{a},1,0)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}=\left(-\frac{c}{a},0,1\right)$
\end_inset

.
 These vectors belong to 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, and the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent (straightforward checks).
 It remains to show that every vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in V$
\end_inset

 is expressed as a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Indeed, any such 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 must have components 
\begin_inset Formula $x,y,z$
\end_inset

 that satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula $x=-\frac{b}{a}y-\frac{c}{a}z$
\end_inset

 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=y\mathbf{e}_{1}+z\mathbf{e}_{2}$

\begin_layout Standard
If there are

 Thus

Theorem: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a finite-dimen\SpecialChar \-

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{m}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{f}_{1},...,\mathbf{f}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are two bases in a vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m\neq n$
\end_inset

.
 I will show that this assumption leads to contradiction, and then it will
 follow that any two bases must have equally many vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $m>n$
\end_inset

.
 The idea of the proof is to take the larger set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{m}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and to replace one of its vectors, say 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{s}$
\end_inset

, by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{1}$
\end_inset

, so that the resulting set of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 vectors
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{s-1},\mathbf{f}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{s+1},...,\mathbf{e}_{m}\right\} \label{eq:aux set 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

is still linearly independent.
 I will prove shortly that such a replacement is possible, assuming only
 that the initial set is linearly independent.
 Then I will continue to replace other vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{3}$
\end_inset

, etc., always keeping the resulting set linearly independent.
 Finally, I will arrive to the linearly independent set 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\{ \mathbf{f}_{1},...,\mathbf{f}_{n},\mathbf{e}_{k_{1}},\mathbf{e}_{k_{2}},...,\mathbf{e}_{k_{m-n}}\right\} ,\]

\end_inset

 which contains all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{j}$
\end_inset

 as well as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(m-n\right)$
\end_inset

 vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k_{1}}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k_{2}}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k_{m-n}}$
\end_inset

 left over from the original set; there must be at least one such vector
 left over because (by assumption) there are more vectors in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 than in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{f}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, in other words, because 
\begin_inset Formula $m-n\geq1$
\end_inset

.
 Since the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{f}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis, the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k_{1}}$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{f}_{1},...,\mathbf{f}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

, so the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{f}_{1},...,\mathbf{f}_{n},\mathbf{e}_{k_{1}},...\right\} $
\end_inset

 cannot be linearly independent.
 This contradiction proves the theorem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to show that it is possible to find the index 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 such that the set\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:aux set 1}

) is linearly independent.
 The required statement is the following: If 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\,|\,1\leq j\leq m\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{f}_{j}\,|\,1\leq j\leq n\right\} $
\end_inset

 are two bases in the space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, and if the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S\equiv\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{k},\mathbf{f}_{1},...,\mathbf{f}_{l}\right\} $
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $l<n$
\end_inset

) is linearly independent then there exists an index 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{s}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 can be replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{l+1}$
\end_inset

 and the new set 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
T\equiv\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{s-1},\mathbf{f}_{l+1},\mathbf{e}_{s+1},...,\mathbf{e}_{k},\mathbf{f}_{1},...,\mathbf{f}_{l}\right\} \label{eq:aux set 3}\end{equation}

\end_inset

is still linearly independent.
 To find a suitable index 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

, we try to decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{l+1}$
\end_inset

 into a linear combination of vectors from 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, we ask whether the set 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S'\equiv S\cup\left\{ \mathbf{f}_{l+1}\right\} =\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{k},\mathbf{f}_{1},...,\mathbf{f}_{l+1}\right\} \]

\end_inset

 is linearly independent.
 There are two possibilities: First, if 
\begin_inset Formula $S'$
\end_inset

 is linearly independent, we can remove any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{s}$
\end_inset

, say 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

, from it, and the resulting set 
\begin_inset Formula \[
T=\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{2},...,\mathbf{e}_{k},\mathbf{f}_{1},...,\mathbf{f}_{l+1}\right\} \]

\end_inset

 will be again linearly independent.
 This set 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is obtained from 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 by replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{l+1}$
\end_inset

, so now there is nothing left to prove.
 Now consider the second possibility: 
\begin_inset Formula $S'$
\end_inset

 is linearly dependent.
 In that case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{l+1}$
\end_inset

 can be decomposed as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbf{f}_{l+1}=\sum_{j=1}^{k}\lambda_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}+\sum_{j=1}^{l}\mu_{j}\mathbf{f}_{j},\label{eq:aux lc 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{j},\mu_{j}$
\end_inset

 are some constants, not all equal to zero.
 Suppose all 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{j}$
\end_inset

 are zero; then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{l+1}$
\end_inset

 would be a linear combination of other 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{j}$
\end_inset

; but this cannot happen for a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{f}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Therefore not all 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{j}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq j\leq k$
\end_inset

 are zero; for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{s}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 This gives us the index 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
 Now we can replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{s}$
\end_inset

 in the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{l+1}$
\end_inset

; it remains to prove that the resulting set 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 defined by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:aux set 3}

\end_inset

) is linearly independent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This last proof is again by contradiction: if 
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

 is linearly 
\emph on

, there exists a vanishing linear combination of the form
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{j=1}^{s-1}\rho_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}+\sigma_{l+1}\mathbf{f}_{l+1}+\sum_{j=s+1}^{k}\rho_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}+\sum_{j=1}^{l}\sigma_{j}\mathbf{f}_{j}=0,\label{eq:aux lc 2}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\rho_{j},\sigma_{j}$
\end_inset

 are not all zero.
 In particular, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{l+1}\neq0$
\end_inset

 because otherwise the initial set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 would be linearly dependent,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{j=1}^{s-1}\rho_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}+\sum_{j=s+1}^{k}\rho_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}+\sum_{j=1}^{l}\sigma_{j}\mathbf{f}_{j}=0.\]

\end_inset

 If we now substitute Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:aux lc 1}

\end_inset

) into Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:aux lc 2}

\end_inset

), we will obtain a vanishing linear combination that contains only vectors
 from the initial set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 in which the coefficient at the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{s}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{l+1}\lambda_{s}\neq0$
\end_inset

 This contradicts the linear independence of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$

 Therefore the set

 of vectors as 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

-tuples 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
u_{i}\equiv\sum_{j=1}^{n}A_{ij}v_{j}.\label{eq:matrix repr}\end{equation}

 into a new vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}=\hat{A}\mathbf{v}$

This picture of matrix transformations is straightforward but relies on
 the coordinate representation of vectors and so has two drawbacks: (i)
 The calculations with matrix components are often unnecessarily cumbersome.
 (ii) Definitions and calculations cannot be easily generalized to infinite-dime
n\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al spaces.
 Nevertheless, many of the results have nothing to do with components and
 
\emph on
do
\emph default
 apply to infinite-dimen\SpecialChar \-

 We need a different approach to characterizing linear transformations of
 vectors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The way out is to concentrate on the

linearity

 of the transformations, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
on the properties
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

which are easy to check directly.
 In fact it turns out that the multiplication law and the matrix representation

 from the above requirements of linearity.

At first sight it might appear that the abstract definition of a linear
 transformation offers much less information than the definition in terms
 of matrices.
 This is true: the abstract definition does not 
\emph on
specify
\emph default
 any particular linear map, it only gives conditions for a map to be linear.
 If the vector space is finite-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al and a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is selected then the familiar matrix picture is immediately recovered from
 the abstract definition.
 Let us first, for simplicity, consider a linear map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}:V\rightarrow V$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement 1:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is a linear map 
\begin_inset Formula $V\rightarrow V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis then there exist numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{jk}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $j,k=1,...,n$
\end_inset

) such that the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 has components 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k}A_{jk}v_{k}$
\end_inset

 if a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 has components 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 we have a decomposition 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}v_{k}\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

 with some components 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 By linearity, the result of application of the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 to the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}\mathbf{v}=\hat{A}\big(\sum_{k=1}^{n}v_{k}\mathbf{e}_{k}\big)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}v_{k}(\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{k}).\]

\end_inset

Therefore, it is sufficient to know how the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 transforms the basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,...,n$
\end_inset

.
 Each of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

 has (in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

) a decomposition
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{k}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}A_{jk}\mathbf{e}_{j},\quad k=1,...,n,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{jk}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq j,k\leq n$
\end_inset

 are some coefficients; these 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{jk}$
\end_inset

 are just some numbers that we can calculate for a specific given linear
 transformation and a specific basis.
 It is convenient to arrange these numbers into a square table (matrix)
 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{jk}$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, we compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}\mathbf{v}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}v_{k}\sum_{j=1}^{n}A_{jk}\mathbf{e}_{j}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}u_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j},\]

\end_inset

where the components 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{j}$
\end_inset

 of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\equiv\hat{A}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 are
\begin_inset Formula \[
u_{j}\equiv\sum_{k=1}^{n}A_{jk}v_{k}.\]

\end_inset

This is exactly the law\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:matrix repr}

\end_inset

) of multiplication of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{jk}$
\end_inset

 by a column vector 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the formula of the matrix representation\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:matrix repr}

\end_inset

) is a necessary consequence of the linearity of a transformation.

The easiest example of a linear map is the

 This is a map

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also define a map which multiplies all vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 by a fixed number 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 This is also obviously a linear map, and we denote it by 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\hat{1}_{V}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

, we may write 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{0}_{V}$
\end_inset

 to denote the map that transforms all vectors into the zero vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another example of a linear transformation is the following.
 Suppose that the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis in the space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

; then any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 is uniquely expressed as a linear combination 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}v_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 We denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)$
\end_inset

 the function that gives the component 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

 of a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Then we define the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}$
\end_inset

 by the formula
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{M}\mathbf{v}\equiv v_{1}\mathbf{e}_{2}=\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)\mathbf{e}_{2}.\]

\end_inset

In other words, the new vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is always parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

 but has the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 It is easy to prove that this map is linear (you need to check that the
 first component of a sum of vectors is equal to the sum of their first
 components).
 The matrix corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \[
M_{ij}=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}

0 & 0 & 0 & ...\\

\begin_layout Standard
The map that shifts all vectors by a fixed vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}_{\mathbf{a}}\mathbf{v}\equiv\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{a}$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{S}_{\mathbf{a}}\left(\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}\right)=\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{a}\neq\hat{S}_{\mathbf{a}}\left(\mathbf{u}\right)+\hat{S}_{\mathbf{a}}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)=\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}+2\mathbf{a}.\]

 is that it is linear? It seems that I cannot specify linear transformations

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is true that the abstract definition of a linear map does not include
 a specification of a particular transformation, unlike the concrete definition
 in terms of a matrix.
 However, it does not mean that matrices are always needed.
 For a particular problem in linear algebra, a particular transformation
 is always specified either as a certain matrix in a given basis, or in
 a 
\emph on
geometric
\emph default
, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
basis-free manner, e.g.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 multiplies a vector by 
\begin_inset Formula $3/2$
\end_inset

 and then projects onto the plane orthogonal to the fixed vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$

\begin_inset Quotes erd

 In this book I concentrate on general properties of linear transformations,
 which are best formulated and studied in the geometric (coordinate-free)
 language rather than in the matrix language.
 Below we will see many coordinate-free calculations with linear maps.
 In Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Linear-operators-as}

 we will also see how to specify arbitrary linear transformations in a coordinat

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}$
\end_inset

 Consider the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 on the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}$
\end_inset

: the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{e}$

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{e}=a\mathbf{e}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $a\in\mathbb{K}$

 is some constant.
 Then by linearity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, for any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=v\mathbf{e}$
\end_inset

 we get 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}=\hat{A}v\mathbf{e}=av\mathbf{e}=a\mathbf{v}$

In words: the map

 acts on a vector

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}+\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 acts on a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 by adding the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}$

 It is straightforward to check that the maps

Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The task of determining the eigenbasis (also called the 
\series bold
diagonalization of an operator
\series default
) is a standard, well-studied problem for which efficient numerical methods
 exist.
 (This book is not about these methods.) However, it is important to know
 that not all operators can be diagonalized.
 The simplest example of a non-diagonalizable operator is one with the matrix
 representation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
0 & 0\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 This operator has 
\emph on
only one
\emph default
 eigenvector, 
\begin_inset Formula ${1 \choose 0}$

 This transformation is a projector onto the subspace spanned by the vectors

Any vector space

\begin_inset Formula $n$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To demonstrate this, it is sufficient to present 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 isomorphism.
 We can always choose a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, so that any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 is decomposed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{e}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Then we define the isomorphism map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}$
\end_inset

 between 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}^{n}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{M}\mathbf{v}\equiv\left(\lambda_{1},...,\lambda_{n}\right).\]

\end_inset

It is easy to see that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}$
\end_inset

 is linear and one-to-one.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vector spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}^{m}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}^{n}$
\end_inset

 are isomorphic only if they have equal dimension, 
\begin_inset Formula $m=n$
\end_inset

.
 The reason they are not isomorphic for 
\begin_inset Formula $m\neq n$
\end_inset

 is that they have different numbers of vectors in a basis, while one-to-one
 linear maps must preserve linear independence and map a basis to a basis.
 (For 
\begin_inset Formula $m\neq n$
\end_inset

, there are plenty of linear maps from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}^{m}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}^{n}$
\end_inset

 but none of them is a one-to-one map.
 It also follows that a one-to-one map between 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}^{m}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}^{n}$
\end_inset

 cannot be linear.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the isomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}$
\end_inset

 constructed in the proof of Statement\InsetSpace ~
1 will depend on the choice of the
 basis: a different basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{i}^{\prime}\right\} $
\end_inset

 yields a different map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 For this reason, the isomorphism

 You have seen the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{End }V\rightarrow\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 in the Exercise\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Examples-of-linear-maps}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $V$

\begin_inset Formula $1\in\mathbb{K}$

 Usually vector spaces do not have any special vectors, so there is no canonical
 isomorphism.
 (However, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{End}\, V$

 does have a special element --- the identity

\begin_layout Standard
At this point I cannot give more interesting examples of canonical maps,
 but I will show many of them later.
 My intuitive picture is that canonically isomorphic spaces have a fundamental
 structural similarity.
 An isomorphism that depends on the choice of basis, as in the Statement\InsetSpace ~

 formulated geometrically (independently of any basis).

Example: Non-isomorphic spaces.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the set of infinite sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},...\right)$
\end_inset

 such that the series 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}+c_{1}+c_{2}+...$
\end_inset

 converges (
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

).
 This subset forms an infinite-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al vector space because the term-by-term
 sum of two convergent series is again a convergent series.
 Consider, on the other hand, the set of infinite sequences 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},...\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}\in\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 are such that the series 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\left|a_{j}\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 converges.
 This set also forms an infinite-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al vector space.
 It might appear that the two spaces are isomorphic because they both look
 like 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

spaces of infinite sequences.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 However, these spaces are actually 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 isomorphic.
 A precise explanation requires much preparatory work; however, it is not
 difficult to see that the components 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

 cannot be used in place of 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

 and neither can 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

 be used instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 This is so because the conditions for the convergence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\left|a_{j}\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 and for the convergence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}c_{j}$
\end_inset

 are quite different.
 For example, we can choose an element of the first space as the sequence
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
c_{j}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{j+1}}\left(-1\right)^{j};\quad\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}c_{j}<\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\text{const}}{n^{3/2}}<\infty.\]

\end_inset

However, the series 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\left|c_{j}\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 diverges.
 Conversely, with 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{j}=\frac{1}{j+1}$
\end_inset

 the series 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\left|a_{j}\right|^{2}$
\end_inset

 converges to 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{6}\pi^{2}$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}a_{j}$
\end_inset

 diverges.
 This is just an illustrative example; I do not wish to go deeper into the
 issues of convergence but merely show that working with infinite-dimen\SpecialChar \-

 spaces requires care.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is unclear how to visualize the dual space when it is defined in such
 abstract terms, as the set of 
\emph on
all
\emph default
 functions having some property.
 How do I know which functions are there, and how can I describe this space
 in more concrete terms? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, we need some work to characterize 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

 more explicitly.
 We will do this in the next subsection by constructing a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Dual basis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

; then any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 is uniquely expressed as a linear combination
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}v_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}.\]

\end_inset

The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

, understood 
\emph on
as a function of the vector
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, is a linear function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 because
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}+\lambda\mathbf{v}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}u_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}+\lambda\sum_{j=1}^{n}v_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left(u_{i}+\lambda v_{j}\right)\mathbf{e}_{j},\]

\end_inset

therefore the first coefficient of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}+\lambda\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{1}+\lambda v_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 So the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq k\leq n$
\end_inset

, are linear functions of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

; therefore they are 
\emph on
covectors
\emph default
, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us denote these covectors by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{n}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Please note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 depends on the 
\emph on
entire
\emph default
 basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and not only on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

, as it might appear from the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is not a result of some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

star
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 operation applied only to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 will change if we change 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

 or any other basis vector.
 This is so because the component 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{1}$
\end_inset

 of a fixed vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 depends not only on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 but also on every other basis vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Theorem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The set of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{n}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the dimension of the dual space 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

 is equal to that of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we show by an explicit calculation that any covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Namely, for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\in V^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)=\mathbf{f}^{*}\big(\sum_{j=1}^{n}v_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}\big)=\sum_{j=1}^{n}v_{j}\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{e}_{j}\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{e}_{j}\right).\]

\end_inset

Note that in the last line the quantities 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{e}_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 are some numbers that do not depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us denote 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi_{j}\equiv\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{e}_{j}\right)$
\end_inset

 for brevity; then we obtain the following linear decomposition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 through the covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\phi_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)\,\Rightarrow\,\mathbf{f}^{*}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\phi_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}.\]

\end_inset

So indeed all covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 are linear combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to prove that the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent.
 If this were not so, we would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{e}_{i}^{*}=0$
\end_inset

 where not all 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 are zero.
 Act on a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,...,n$
\end_inset

) with this linear combination and get
\begin_inset Formula \[
0\,{\lyxbuildrel!\above=}\,(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{e}_{i}^{*})(\mathbf{e}_{k})=\lambda_{k},\quad k=1,...,n.\]

\end_inset

Hence all 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{k}$
\end_inset

 are zero.

Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Vectors are usually 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

 by listing their components in some basis.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1}^{*},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}^{*}\right\} $

 is its dual basis.
 If the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

 has components 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{k}\right\} $

 How come?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes, it does look like that, but Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:f star v}

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 are from 
\emph on
different
\emph default
 vector spaces.
 I would rather say that the scalar product resembles Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:f star v}

), and this happens only for a special choice of basis (an 
\emph on
orthonormal

\begin_layout Paragraph
Question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dual basis still seems too abstract to me.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is the three-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al space of polynomials in the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 with real coefficients and degree no more than 2.
 The three polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 1,x,x^{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 How can I compute explicitly the dual basis to this basis?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An arbitrary vector from this space is a polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $a+bx+cx^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The basis dual to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 1,x,x^{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 consists of three covectors.
 Let us denote the set of these covectors by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1}^{*},\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*},\mathbf{e}_{3}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 These covectors are linear functions defined like this:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}\left(a+bx+cx^{2}\right) & =a,\\
\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*}\left(a+bx+cx^{2}\right) & =b,\\
\mathbf{e}_{3}^{*}\left(a+bx+cx^{2}\right) & =c.\end{align*}

\end_inset

If you like, you can visualize them as differential operators acting on
 the polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)$
\end_inset

 like this:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}(p)=\left.p(x)\right|_{x=0};\quad\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*}(p)=\left.\frac{dp}{dx}\right|_{x=0};\quad\mathbf{e}_{3}^{*}(p)=\frac{1}{2}\left.\frac{d^{2}p}{dx^{2}}\right|_{x=0}.\]

\end_inset

However, this is a bit too complicated; the covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{3}^{*}$
\end_inset

 just extracts the coefficient of the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 To make it clear that, say, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{3}^{*}$
\end_inset

 can be evaluated without taking derivatives or limits, we may write the
 formulas for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}(p)$
\end_inset

 in another equivalent way, e.g.
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*}(p)=\frac{p(1)-p(-1)}{2},\quad\mathbf{e}_{3}^{*}(p)=\frac{p(1)-2p(0)+p(-1)}{2}.\]

\end_inset

It is straightforward to check that these formulas are indeed equivalent
 by substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)=a+bx+cx^{2}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I'm still not sure what to do in the general case.
 For example, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ 1,1+x,1+x+\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is also a basis in the space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 of quadratic polynomials.
 How do I explicitly compute the dual basis now? The previous trick with
 derivatives does not work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's denote this basis by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{f}_{1},\mathbf{f}_{2},\mathbf{f}_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

; we are looking for the dual basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{f}_{1}^{*},\mathbf{f}_{2}^{*},\mathbf{f}_{3}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 It will certainly be sufficiently explicit if we manage to express the
 covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}$
\end_inset

 through the covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1}^{*},\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*},\mathbf{e}_{3}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 that we just found previously.
 Since the set of covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1}^{*},\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*},\mathbf{e}_{3}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

, we expect that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1}^{*},\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*},\mathbf{e}_{3}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 with some constant coefficients, and similarly 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{3}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us, for instance, determine 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 We write 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{f}_{1}^{*}=A\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}+B\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*}+C\mathbf{e}_{3}^{*}\]

\end_inset

with unknown coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B,C$
\end_inset

.
 By definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 acting on an arbitrary vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=c_{1}\mathbf{f}_{1}+c_{2}\mathbf{f}_{2}+c_{3}\mathbf{f}_{3}$
\end_inset

 must yield 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,2,3$
\end_inset

 yield the coefficients of the polynomial at 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
c_{1} & \,{\lyxbuildrel!\above=}\,\mathbf{f}_{1}^{*}(\mathbf{v})=\mathbf{f}_{1}^{*}\left(c_{1}\mathbf{f}_{1}+c_{2}\mathbf{f}_{2}+c_{3}\mathbf{f}_{3}\right)\\
 & =\left(A\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}+B\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*}+C\mathbf{e}_{3}^{*}\right)\left(c_{1}\mathbf{f}_{1}+c_{2}\mathbf{f}_{2}+c_{3}\mathbf{f}_{3}\right)\\
 & =\left(A\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}+B\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*}+C\mathbf{e}_{3}^{*}\right)\left(c_{1}+c_{2}\left(1+x\right)+c_{3}\big(1+x+{\textstyle \frac{1}{2}}x^{2}\big)\right)\\
 & =Ac_{1}+Ac_{2}+Ac_{3}+Bc_{2}+Bc_{3}+{\textstyle \frac{1}{2}}Cc_{3}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since this must hold for every 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1},c_{2},c_{3}$
\end_inset

, we obtain a system of equations for the unknown constants 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B,C$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
A & =1;\\
A+B & =0;\\
A+B+{\textstyle \frac{1}{2}}C & =0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The solution is 
\begin_inset Formula $A=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $B=-1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $C=0$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{1}^{*}=\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}-\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 In the same way we can determine 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{3}^{*}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard

 By definition, the property 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\neq0$

 means that there exists at least one vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\in V$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{u})\neq0$
\end_inset

 Given the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{1}\equiv\frac{1}{\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right)}\mathbf{u}.\]

\end_inset

It follows (using the linearity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

) that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{v}_{1})=1$
\end_inset

.
 Then by Exercise\InsetSpace ~
1 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:All-bases-have}

\end_inset

 the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 can be completed to 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{w}_{2},...,\mathbf{w}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Thereafter we define the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

 by the formula
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{i}\equiv\mathbf{w}_{i}-\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{w}_{i}\right)\mathbf{v}_{1},\quad2\leq i\leq N,\]

\end_inset

and obtain a set of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{v}_{1})=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{v}_{i})=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $2\leq i\leq N$
\end_inset

.
 This set is linearly independent because a linear dependence among 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{v}_{i}=\big(\lambda_{1}-\sum_{i=2}^{N}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{w}_{i})\big)\mathbf{v}_{1}+\sum_{i=2}^{N}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{w}_{i},\]

\end_inset

 together with the linear independence of the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{w}_{2},...,\mathbf{w}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

, forces 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i\geq2$
\end_inset

 and hence also 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=0$
\end_inset

Covectors are convenient for characterizing hyperplanes.

 The set of points whose coordinates satisfy the linear equation

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of writing a linear equation with coordinates, one can write a covector
 applied to the vector of coordinates.
 For example, the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $x+2y-z=0$
\end_inset

 can be rewritten as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{x})=0$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\equiv\{ x,y,z\}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\in\left(\mathbb{R}^{3}\right)^{*}$
\end_inset

 is expressed through the dual basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\right\} $

\begin_inset Formula \[

Statement:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The hyperplane annihilated by a nonzero covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is a subspace of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $N\equiv\dim V$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is clear that the hyperplane is a subspace of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 because for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{2}$
\end_inset

 in the hyperplane we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{x}_{1}+\lambda\mathbf{x}_{2})=\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{x}_{1})+\lambda\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{x}_{2})=0.\]

\end_inset

Hence any linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{2}$
\end_inset

 also belongs to the hyperplane, so the hyperplane is a subspace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the dimension of this subspace, we would like to construct
 a basis for the hyperplane.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\in V^{*}$
\end_inset

 is a nonzero covector, there exists some vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\in V$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right)\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 (This vector does not belong to the hyperplane.) The idea is to complete
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 to a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N-1}\}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{u})\neq0$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{v}_{i})=0$
\end_inset

; then 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N-1}\}$
\end_inset

 will be a basis in the hyperplane.
 To find such a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N-1}\}$
\end_inset

, let us first complete 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 to 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u}_{1},...,\mathbf{u}_{N-1}\}$
\end_inset

.
 Then we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}=\mathbf{u}_{i}-c_{i}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 with appropriately chosen 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 To achieve 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{v}_{i})=0$
\end_inset

, we set
\begin_inset Formula \[
c_{i}=\frac{\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{u}_{i})}{\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{u})}.\]

\end_inset

 It remains to prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N-1}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is again a basis.
 Applying 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 to a supposedly existing vanishing linear combination,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lambda\mathbf{u}+\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{v}_{i}=0,\]

\end_inset

we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

.
 Expressing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

, we obtain a vanishing linear combination of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u}_{1},...,\mathbf{u}_{N-1}\}$
\end_inset

 with coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, all 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 are zero, and so the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N-1}\}$
\end_inset

 is linearly independent and thus a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N-1}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis in the hyperplane.
 By construction, every 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 belongs to the hyperplane, and so does every linear combination of the
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

's.
 It remains to show that every 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{x})=0$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as a linear combination of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 For any such 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 we have the decomposition in the basis
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N-1}\right\} $
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{x}=\lambda\mathbf{u}+\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{v}_{i}.\]

\end_inset

Applying 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 to this, we find 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination only of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 This shows that the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 spans the hyperplane.
 The set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent since it is a subset of a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis in the hyperplane.
 Therefore, the hyperplane has dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

.

not
\emph default
 a subspace of

 and may be described more constructively as follows.
 We first obtain a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N-1}\}$
\end_inset

 of the hyperplane 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{x})=0$
\end_inset

 We then choose some vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{u})\neq0$
\end_inset

; such a vector exists since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\neq0$
\end_inset

 We can then multiply 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 by a constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\lambda\mathbf{u})=\alpha$
\end_inset

, that is, the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 belongs to the affine hyperplane.
 Now, every vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 of the form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{x}=\lambda\mathbf{u}+\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{v}_{i},\]

\end_inset

with arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

, belongs to the hyperplane since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{x})=\alpha$

 by construction.
 Thus, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{x}\,|\,\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{x})=\alpha\}$
\end_inset

 is a hyperplane drawn through 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 Affine hyperplanes described by the same covector

Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes W$

 is a vector space, the zero element 
\begin_inset Formula $0\in V\otimes W$
\end_inset

 can be obtained by multiplying any other element of 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes W$

 by the number 
\begin_inset Formula $0$

 So, according to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(

\begin_inset Formula $0=0\left(\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{w}\right)=\left(0\mathbf{v}\right)\otimes\mathbf{w}=0\otimes\mathbf{w}=0\otimes(0\mathbf{w})=0\otimes0$

 In other words, the zero element is represented by the tensor

 It will not cause confusion if we simply write 
\begin_inset Formula $0$

\shape slanted
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to the above definition, we may perform calculations with the
 tensor product expressions by expanding brackets or moving scalar factors,
 as if 
\begin_inset Formula $\otimes$
\end_inset

 is a kind of multiplication.
 For example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}\in V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}_{i}\in W$
\end_inset

 then
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\frac{1}{3}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}-\mathbf{v}_{2}\right)\otimes\left(\mathbf{w}_{1}-2\mathbf{w}_{2}\right) & =\frac{1}{3}\mathbf{v}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{1}-\frac{1}{3}\mathbf{v}_{2}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{1}\\
 & -\frac{2}{3}\mathbf{v}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{2}+\frac{2}{3}\mathbf{v}_{2}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{2}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Note that we cannot simplify this expression any further, because by definition
 
\emph on
no other combinations

(

 This calculation illustrates that 
\begin_inset Formula $\otimes$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

 is not a new vector from

\begin_layout Standard
We actually 
\emph on
define

 the operation 
\begin_inset Formula $\otimes$

 through these properties.
 In other words, the object 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is defined as an expression with which one may perform certain manipulations.
 Here is a more formal definition of the tensor product space.
 We first consider the space of 
\emph on
all

 formal linear combinations
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lambda_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{1}+...+\lambda_{n}\mathbf{v}_{n}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{n},\]

\end_inset

which is a very large vector space.
 Then we introduce equivalence relations expressed by Eqs.\InsetSpace ~

 with respect to these relations.

 For example,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

Example 1: polynomials.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 be the space of polynomials having a degree 
\begin_inset Formula $\leq2$
\end_inset

 in the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, and let 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

 be the space of polynomials of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $\leq2$
\end_inset

 in the variable 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

.
 We consider the tensor product of the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)=1+x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q(y)=y^{2}-2y$
\end_inset

.
 Expanding the tensor product according to the axioms, we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(1+x\right)\otimes\left(y^{2}-2y\right)=1\otimes y^{2}-1\otimes2y+x\otimes y^{2}-x\otimes2y.\]

\end_inset

Let us compare this with the formula we would obtain by multiplying the
 polynomials in the conventional way,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(1+x\right)\left(y^{2}-2y\right)=y^{2}-2y+xy^{2}-2xy.\]

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $1\otimes2y=2\otimes y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x\otimes2y=2x\otimes y$
\end_inset

 according to the axioms of the tensor product.
 So we can see that the tensor product space 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes W$
\end_inset

 has a natural interpretation through the algebra of polynomials.
 The space 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes W$
\end_inset

 can be visualized as the space of polynomials in both 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 of degree at most 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 in each variable.
 To make this interpretation precise, we can construct a canonical isomorphism
 between the space 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes W$
\end_inset

 and the space of polynomials in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $y$
\end_inset

 of degree at most 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 in each variable.
 The isomorphism maps the tensor

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$

 Then the tensor product of

 is, by definition, the space of combinations of the form
\begin_inset Formula \[

 and so we will not need to

any element of

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1,2}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}$

 For brevity one can write such expressions as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}+\mathbf{v}_{2}\text{i}$
\end_inset

 One also writes 
\begin_inset Formula ${\mathbb{R}^{3}\otimes_{\mathbb{R}}\mathbb{C}}$
\end_inset

 to emphasize the fact that it is a space over 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

 In other words,

\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes\mathbb{K}$

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 is a vector space over itself, we can consider the tensor product of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}$

 However, nothing is gained: the space 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 is canonically isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 This can be easily verified: an element 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 is by definition an expression of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{v}_{1}\otimes\lambda_{1}+...+\mathbf{v}_{n}\otimes\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

, however, it follows from the axiom\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:tp props 0}

)  that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\otimes\lambda_{1}=\left(\lambda_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}\right)\otimes1$
\end_inset

, therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\left(\lambda_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}+...+\lambda_{n}\mathbf{v}_{n}\right)\otimes1$
\end_inset

 Thus for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in V\otimes\mathbb{K}$

 there exists a unique 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{v}\otimes1$

 In other words, there is a canonical isomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $V\rightarrow V\otimes\mathbb{K}$

\end_inset

 be the standard bases in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{m}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 respectively.
 The vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{m}\otimes\mathbb{R}^{n}$

\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

The vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i},\mathbf{w}_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be decomposed as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\lambda_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{j},\quad\mathbf{w}_{i}=\sum_{l=1}^{n}\mu_{il}\mathbf{f}_{l},\label{eq:v w expr}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{ij}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu_{ij}$
\end_inset

 are some coefficients.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\sum_{i=1}^{k}\mathbf{v}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{i} & =\sum_{i=1}^{k}\left(\sum_{j=1}^{m}\lambda_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{j}\right)\otimes\left(\sum_{l=1}^{n}\mu_{il}\mathbf{f}_{l}\right)\\

 & =\sum_{j=1}^{m}\sum_{l=1}^{n}C_{jl}\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{l},\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $C_{jl}\equiv\sum_{i=1}^{k}\lambda_{ij}\mu_{il}$
\end_inset

 is a certain set of numbers.
 In other words, an arbitrary element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{m}\otimes\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{l}$
\end_inset

.
 In Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Dimension-of-tensor}

 (after some preparatory work) we will prove that the the set of tensors
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{l}\,|\,1\leq j\leq m,1\leq l\leq n\right\} \]

\end_inset

 is linearly independent and therefore is a basis in the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{m}\otimes\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

 It follows that the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{m}\otimes\mathbb{R}^{n}$

\begin_inset Formula $mn$

\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{k}+\lambda\mathbf{v}_{k}^{\prime}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{k}^{\prime}\right)=\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}_{k}\right)\mathbf{w}_{k}+\lambda\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}_{k}^{\prime}\right)\mathbf{w}_{k}^{\prime}.\]

\end_inset

This follows from the definition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:fg rule}

\end_inset

) and the linearity of the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 However, there is one potential problem: there exist 
\emph on
many
\emph default
 representations of an element 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in V\otimes W$
\end_inset

 as an expression of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{k}$
\end_inset

 with different choices of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{k},\mathbf{w}_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we need to show that the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is well-defined by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:fg rule}

\end_inset

), i.e.\InsetSpace ~
that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(A)$
\end_inset

 is always the same vector regardless of the choice of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}_{k}$
\end_inset

 used to represent 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\sum_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Recall that different expressions of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{k}$
\end_inset

 can be equal as a consequence of the axioms\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:tp props 0}

\end_inset

)--(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:tp props 2}

\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, we need to prove that a tensor equality
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{k}=\sum_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}^{\prime}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{k}^{\prime}\label{eq:vw equal}\end{equation}

\end_inset

entails
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{f}^{*}\big(\sum_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{k}\big)=\mathbf{f}^{*}\big(\sum_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}^{\prime}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{k}^{\prime}\big).\]

\end_inset

 To prove this, we need to use the definition of the tensor product.
 Two expressions in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:vw equal}

\end_inset

) can be equal 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 if they are related by a chain of identities of the form\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:tp props 0}

\end_inset

)--(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:tp props 2}

\end_inset

), therefore it is sufficient to prove that the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 transforms both sides of each of those identities into the same vector.
 This is verified by explicit calculations, for example we need to check
 that
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\lambda\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{w}\right) & =\lambda\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{w}\right),\\
\mathbf{f}^{*}\left[\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}+\mathbf{v}_{2}\right)\otimes\mathbf{w}\right] & =\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{w}\right)+\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}_{2}\otimes\mathbf{w}\right),\\
\mathbf{f}^{*}\left[\mathbf{v}\otimes\left(\mathbf{w}_{1}+\mathbf{w}_{2}\right)\right] & =\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{1}\right)+\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{2}\right).\end{align*}

\end_inset

These simple calculations look tautological, so please check that you can
 do them and explain why they are necessary for this proof.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We need to prove that a vanishing linear combination 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{j=1}^{m}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\lambda_{jk}\mathbf{v}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{k}=0\label{eq:comb1 vw}\end{equation}

\end_inset

is possible only if all 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{jk}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Let us choose some fixed value 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{1}$
\end_inset

; we will now prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{j_{1}k}=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 By the result of Exercise\InsetSpace ~
1 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Dual-vector-space}

\end_inset

 there exists a covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\in V^{*}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}_{j}\right)=\delta_{j_{1}j}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,n$
\end_inset

.
 Then we apply the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}:V\otimes W\rightarrow W$
\end_inset

 defined in Lemma\InsetSpace ~
1 to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:comb1 vw}

\end_inset

).
 On the one hand, it follows from Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:comb1 vw}

\end_inset

) that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{f}^{*}\big[\sum_{j=1}^{m}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\lambda_{jk}\mathbf{v}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{k}\big]=\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(0\right)=0.\]

\end_inset

On the other hand, by definition of the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{f}^{*}\big[\sum_{j=1}^{m}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\lambda_{jk}\mathbf{v}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{k}\big] & =\sum_{j=1}^{m}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\lambda_{jk}\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}_{j}\right)\mathbf{w}_{k}\\
 & =\sum_{j=1}^{m}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\lambda_{jk}\delta_{j_{1}j}\mathbf{w}_{k}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\lambda_{j_{1}k}\mathbf{w}_{k}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k}\lambda_{j_{1}k}\mathbf{w}_{k}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Since the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{w}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent, we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{j_{1}k}=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,...,n$

\begin_layout Standard
By definition of dimension, there exist linearly independent sets of

 respectively.
 By Lemma\InsetSpace ~
1 the set of

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{k}\right\} $

 Therefore this set is a basis.
 Hence, there are no linearly independent sets of 
\begin_inset Formula $mn+1$

\begin_inset Formula $\dim\left(V\otimes W\right)=mn$

Higher-rank tensor products

The tensor product of several spaces is defined similarly, e.g.\InsetSpace ~

Alternatively (and equivalently) one can define the space

\begin_layout Standard
If we only work with one space

\end_inset

 and if all other spaces are constructed out of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

 using the tensor product, then we only need spaces of the form 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\underbrace{V\otimes...\otimes V}_{m}\otimes\underbrace{V^{*}\otimes...\otimes V^{*}}_{n}.\]

\end_inset

Elements of such spaces are called 
\series bold
tensors of

\series bold
rank
\series default
 
\begin_inset Formula $(m,n)$
\end_inset

.
 For example, vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 have rank 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,0\right)$
\end_inset

, covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\in V^{*}$
\end_inset

 have rank 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,1\right)$

\end_inset

 have rank 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,1\right)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V$
\end_inset

 have rank 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(2,0\right)$
\end_inset

 Scalars from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 have rank 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(0,0\right)$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In many applications, the spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

 are identified (e.g.\InsetSpace ~
using a scalar product; see below).
 In that case, the rank is reduced to a single number --- the sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, in this simplified counting, tensors from 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V^{*}$
\end_inset

 as well as tensors from 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V$
\end_inset

 have rank 2.

 Is there something like the formula

\begin_layout Standard
The tensor product construction may appear an abstract plaything at this
 point, but in fact it is a universal tool to describe linear maps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen that the set of all linear operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}:V\rightarrow V$

 is a vector space because one can naturally define the sum of two operators

\begin_layout Standard
In this section I will show that linear operators can be thought of as elements

\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V^{*}$

 This gives a convenient way to represent a linear operator by a coordinate-free
 formula.
 Later we will see that the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Hom}\left(V,W\right)$
\end_inset

 of linear maps 
\begin_inset Formula $V\rightarrow W$
\end_inset

 is canonically isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $W\otimes V^{*}$

\begin_layout Subsection
Tensors as linear operators

\begin_layout Standard

 acts as a linear map 
\begin_inset Formula $V\rightarrow V$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Paragraph
Lemma:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in V\otimes V^{*}$
\end_inset

 expressed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
A\equiv\sum_{j=1}^{k}\mathbf{v}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}\]

\end_inset

 defines a linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}:V\rightarrow V$
\end_inset

 according to the formula
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\hat{A}\mathbf{x}\equiv\sum_{j=1}^{k}\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}(\mathbf{x})\,\mathbf{v}_{j}.\label{eq:Ax action}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compare this linear map with the linear map defined in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:fg rule}

\end_inset

), Lemma\InsetSpace ~
2 of Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Dimension-of-tensor}

\end_inset

.
 We need to prove two statements: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(1) The transformation is linear, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}(\mathbf{x}+\lambda\mathbf{y})=\hat{A}\mathbf{x}+\lambda\hat{A}\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
(2) The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 does not depend on the decomposition of the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 using particular vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 and covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}$
\end_inset

: two decompositions of the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=\sum_{j=1}^{k}\mathbf{v}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}=\sum_{j=1}^{l}\mathbf{w}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{g}_{j}^{*},\]

\end_inset

yield the same operator,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}\mathbf{x}=\sum_{j=1}^{k}\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}(\mathbf{x})\,\mathbf{v}_{j}=\sum_{j=1}^{l}\mathbf{g}_{j}^{*}(\mathbf{x})\,\mathbf{w}_{j},\quad\forall\mathbf{x}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first statement, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\left(\mathbf{x}+\lambda\mathbf{y}\right)=\hat{A}\mathbf{x}+\lambda\hat{A}\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

, follows from the linearity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}$
\end_inset

 as a map 
\begin_inset Formula $V\rightarrow\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 and is easy to verify by explicit calculation:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{A}(\mathbf{x}+\lambda\mathbf{y}) & =\sum_{j=1}^{k}\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}(\mathbf{x}+\lambda\mathbf{y})\,\mathbf{v}_{j}\\
 & =\sum_{j=1}^{k}\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}(\mathbf{x})\,\mathbf{v}_{j}+\lambda\sum_{j=1}^{k}\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}(\mathbf{y})\,\mathbf{v}_{j}\\
 & =\hat{A}\mathbf{x}+\lambda\hat{A}\mathbf{y}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The second statement is proved using the axioms\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:tp props 0}

\end_inset

)--(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:tp props 2}

\end_inset

) of the tensor product.
 Two different expressions for the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 can be equal only if they are related through the axioms\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:tp props 0}

\end_inset

)--(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:tp props 2}

\end_inset

).
 So it suffices to check that the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 remains unchanged when we use each of the three axioms to replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{k}\mathbf{v}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}$
\end_inset

 by an equivalent tensor expression.
 Let us check the first axiom: We need to compare the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j}\left(\mathbf{u}_{j}+\mathbf{v}_{j}\right)\otimes\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}$
\end_inset

 on a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in V$
\end_inset

 and the action of the sum of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j}\mathbf{u}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j}\mathbf{v}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}$
\end_inset

 on the same vector:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{A}\mathbf{x} & =\bigg[\sum_{j}\left(\mathbf{u}_{j}+\mathbf{v}_{j}\right)\otimes\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}\bigg]\mathbf{x}\\
 & =\sum_{j}\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\left(\mathbf{u}_{j}+\mathbf{v}_{j}\right)\\
 & =\bigg[\sum_{j}\mathbf{u}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}\bigg]\mathbf{x}+\bigg[\sum_{j}\mathbf{v}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}\bigg]\mathbf{x}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 remains unchanged for every 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, which means that the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 itself is unchanged.
 Similarly, we (more precisely, 
\emph on
you
\emph default
) can check directly that the other two axioms also leave 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 unchanged.
 It follows that the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 on a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, as defined by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Ax action}

\end_inset

), is independent of the choice of representation of the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 through vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 and covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{j}^{*}$

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen that any tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in V\otimes V^{*}$
\end_inset

 has a corresponding linear map in 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{End }V$
\end_inset

.
 Now conversely, let 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\in\textrm{End }V$
\end_inset

 be a linear operator and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 be a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 We will now find such covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}\in V^{*}$
\end_inset

 that the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 The required covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}\in V^{*}$
\end_inset

 can be defined by the formula
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\equiv\mathbf{v}_{k}^{*}(\hat{A}\mathbf{x}),\quad\forall\mathbf{x}\in V,\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{k}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the dual basis.
 With this definition, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\bigg[\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathbf{v}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}\bigg]\mathbf{x}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\mathbf{v}_{k}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathbf{v}_{k}^{*}(\hat{A}\mathbf{x})\mathbf{v}_{k}=\hat{A}\mathbf{x}.\]

\end_inset

The last equality is based on the formula 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathbf{v}_{k}^{*}\left(\mathbf{y}\right)\mathbf{v}_{k}=\mathbf{y},\]

\end_inset

 which holds because the components of a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{k}^{*}\left(\mathbf{y}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Then it follows from the definition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Ax action}

\begin_inset Formula $\big[\sum_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}\big]\mathbf{x}=\hat{A}\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 There is a canonical isomorphism

 between the spaces

\begin_inset Formula \[

Conversely, a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathbf{v}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is mapped into the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
(1)
\series default
 To prove that a map is an isomorphism of vector spaces, we need to show
 that this map is linear and 
\series bold
bijective
\series default
 (one-to-one).
 Linearity easily follows from the definition of the map \InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{}$
\end_inset

\InsetSpace ~
: if 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B\in V\otimes V^{*}$
\end_inset

 are two tensors then 
\begin_inset Formula $A+\lambda B\in V\otimes V^{*}$
\end_inset

 is mapped into 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}+\lambda\hat{B}$
\end_inset

.
 To prove the bijectivity, we need to show that for any operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 there exists a corresponding tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\sum_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 (this we have already shown above), and that two different tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $A\neq B$
\end_inset

 cannot be mapped into the same operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}=\hat{B}$
\end_inset

.
 If two different tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $A\neq B$
\end_inset

 were mapped into the same operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}=\hat{B}$
\end_inset

, it would follow from the linearity of \InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{}$
\end_inset

\InsetSpace ~
 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\widehat{A-B}=\hat{A}-\hat{B}=0$
\end_inset

, in other words, that a nonzero tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $C\equiv A-B\neq0$
\end_inset

 is mapped into the zero operator, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}=0$
\end_inset

.
 We will now arrive to a contradiction.
 The tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 has a decomposition 
\begin_inset Formula $C=\sum_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{c}_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $C\neq0$
\end_inset

, it follows that at least one covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is nonzero.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}_{1}^{*}\neq0$
\end_inset

; then there exists at least one vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in V$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}_{1}^{*}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 We now act on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 with the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}$
\end_inset

: by assumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{C}=\hat{A}-\hat{B}=0$
\end_inset

, but at the same time
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\hat{C}\mathbf{x}\equiv\sum_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}\mathbf{c}_{k}^{*}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=\mathbf{v}_{1}\mathbf{c}_{1}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)+...\]

\end_inset

This is a contradiction because a linear combination of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 with at least one nonzero coefficient cannot vanish (the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are a basis).

\end_inset

, when we defined the covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 However, this map is canonical because it is the same map for all choices
 of the basis.
 Indeed, if we choose another basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{k}^{\prime}\right\} $
\end_inset

 then of course the covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{k}^{\prime*}$
\end_inset

 will be different from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

, but the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 will remain the same,
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathbf{v}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}=A^{\prime}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathbf{v}_{k}^{\prime}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{k}^{\prime*}\in V\otimes V^{*},\]

\end_inset

because (as we just proved) different tensors are always mapped into different
 operators.

\end_inset

 defined canonically?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes.
 The tensor

 we choose; of course the correct dual basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{k}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 must be used.
 In other words, for any two bases 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

, and with 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{k}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{k}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 being the corresponding dual bases, we have the tensor equality
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{v}_{k}^{*}=\sum_{k}\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{k}\otimes\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{k}^{*}.\]

\end_inset

 We have proved this in Theorem\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Linear-operators-as-tensors}

\end_inset

 when we established that two different tensors are always mapped into different
 operators by the map \InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{}$
\end_inset

\InsetSpace ~
.
 One can say that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{v}_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\emph on
canonically defined tensor
\emph default
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V^{*}$
\end_inset

 since it is the unique tensor corresponding to the canonically defined
 identity operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{1}_{V}$
\end_inset

.
 Recall that a given tensor can be written as a linear combination of tensor
 products in many different ways! Here is a worked-out example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{v}_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 be a basis in a two-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al space; let 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1}^{*},\mathbf{v}_{2}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 be the corresponding dual basis.
 We can choose another basis, e.g.
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\{ \mathbf{w}_{1},\mathbf{w}_{2}\right\} \equiv\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1}+\mathbf{v}_{2},\mathbf{v}_{1}-\mathbf{v}_{2}\right\} .\]

\end_inset

 Its dual basis is (verify this!)
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{w}_{1}^{*}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}+\mathbf{v}_{2}^{*}\right),\quad\mathbf{w}_{2}^{*}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}-\mathbf{v}_{2}^{*}\right).\]

\end_inset

 Then we compute the identity tensor:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{1}=\mathbf{w}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{1}^{*}+\mathbf{w}_{2}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{2}^{*} & =\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}+\mathbf{v}_{2}\right)\otimes\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}+\mathbf{v}_{2}^{*}\right)\\
 & +\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}-\mathbf{v}_{2}\right)\otimes\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}-\mathbf{v}_{2}^{*}\right)\\
 & =\mathbf{v}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}+\mathbf{v}_{2}\otimes\mathbf{v}_{2}^{*}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The tensor expressions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{1}^{*}+\mathbf{w}_{2}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}+\mathbf{v}_{2}\otimes\mathbf{v}_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 are

(I give a solution because it is an instructive calculation showing how

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, the eigenvalue equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}=\lambda\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 yields 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\alpha\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{u}\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{x})=\lambda\mathbf{x}.\]

\end_inset

 Either 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\alpha$
\end_inset

 and then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=0$
\end_inset

, or 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\neq\alpha$
\end_inset

 and then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

; substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 into the above equation, we find 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\alpha+\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 has two eigenvalues, 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\alpha+\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right)$
\end_inset

 The eigenspace with the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\alpha$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in V$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=0$

 The eigenspace with the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\alpha+\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right)$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$

 (It might happen that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right)=0$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right\} $

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k}$

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{e}_{3},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $

 It is convenient to adapt this basis to the given covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}^{*}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}^{*}(\mathbf{e}_{k})=0$

 (We may replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k}\mapsto\mathbf{e}_{k}-a_{k}\mathbf{u}-b_{k}\mathbf{v}$

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$

 can be expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\alpha\mathbf{u}+\beta\mathbf{v}+\sum_{k=3}^{N}y_{k}\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

 in this basis, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

 are unknown constants.
 Our goal is therefore to determine 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{k}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Denote 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}\equiv\sum_{k=3}^{N}y_{k}\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

 and transform the eigenvalue equation using the given conditions 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{v})=\mathbf{g}^{*}(\mathbf{u})=0$
\end_inset

 as well as the properties 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{y})=\mathbf{g}^{*}(\mathbf{y})=0$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{B}\mathbf{x}-\lambda\mathbf{x}= & \mathbf{u}\left(\alpha\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right)+\beta\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)+\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{y}\right)-\alpha\lambda\right)\\
 & +\mathbf{v}\left(\alpha\mathbf{g}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right)+\beta\mathbf{g}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)+\mathbf{g}^{*}\left(\mathbf{y}\right)-\beta\lambda\right)-\lambda\mathbf{y}\\
= & \mathbf{u}\left(\alpha\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right)-\alpha\lambda\right)+\mathbf{v}\left(\beta\mathbf{g}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)-\beta\lambda\right)-\lambda\mathbf{y}=0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The above equation says that a certain linear combination of the vectors
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 is zero.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}\neq0$
\end_inset

, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{e}_{3},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis (see Exercise\InsetSpace ~
1 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Dimension-of-V}

\end_inset

).
 Then the linear combination of the three vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 can be zero only if all three coefficients are zero.
 On the other hand, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}=0$
\end_inset

 then we are left only with two coefficients that must vanish.
 Thus, we can proceed by considering separately the two possible cases,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}\neq0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin with the case 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}=0$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}\mathbf{x}-\lambda\mathbf{x}=0$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to the vanishing of the linear combination
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}\left(\alpha\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{u})-\alpha\lambda\right)+\mathbf{v}\left(\beta\mathbf{g}^{*}(\mathbf{v})-\beta\lambda\right)=0.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent, this linear combination can vanish only when both
 coefficients vanish:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\alpha\left(\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right)-\lambda\right) & =0,\\
\beta\left(\mathbf{g}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)-\lambda\right) & =0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

This is a system of two linear equations for the two unknowns 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

; when we solve it, we will determine the possible eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\alpha\mathbf{u}+\beta\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 and the corresponding eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Note that we are looking for 
\emph on
nonzero
\emph default
 solutions, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 cannot be both zero.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\neq0$
\end_inset

, we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{u})$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{u})\neq\mathbf{g}^{*}(\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

, the second equation forces 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta=0$
\end_inset

.
 Otherwise, any 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is a solution.
 Likewise, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\neq0$
\end_inset

 then we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=\mathbf{g}^{*}(\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore we obtain the following possibilities:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a) 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{u})\neq\mathbf{g}^{*}(\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 with eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{1}=\alpha\mathbf{u}$

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=\mathbf{g}^{*}(\mathbf{v})$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b) 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{u})=\mathbf{g}^{*}(\mathbf{v})$

\begin_layout Standard
Standard matrix algebra says that a homogeneous system of equations can
 have nontrivial solutions only when the determinant vanishes (below, when
 we get to determinants, I will also derive this property from a coordinate-free
 approach).
 Thus, if the following determinant is nonzero,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left|\begin{array}{cc}
\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right) & \mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)\\
\mathbf{g}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right) & \mathbf{g}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)\end{array}\right|=\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right)\mathbf{g}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)-\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)\mathbf{g}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right)\neq0,\]

\end_inset

the only solution of the first system is 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{y}\right)=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}^{*}\left(\mathbf{y}\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the eigenspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

 is the intersection of the subspaces annihilated by the covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 If the above determinant is zero, additional 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

 eigenvectors exist outside of that subspace.
 The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the above matrix define the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\neq0$
\end_inset

 solutions (find them yourself).
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we consider the case 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}\neq0$
\end_inset

 (recall that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 is an unknown vector from the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Span}\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{3},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

).
 In this case, we obtain a system of linear equations for the set of unknowns
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\alpha,\beta,\lambda,\mathbf{y}\right)$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\alpha\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right)-\alpha\lambda & =0,\\
\beta\mathbf{g}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)-\beta\lambda & =0,\\
-\lambda & =0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

This system is simplified, using 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

, to
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\alpha\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right) & =0,\\
\beta\mathbf{g}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right) & =0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{u})\neq0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}^{*}(\mathbf{v})\neq0$
\end_inset

, the only solution is 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha=\beta=0$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the eigenvector is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 for any nonzero 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}\in\text{Span}\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{3},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

Remark:

\begin_layout Standard
The preceding exercise serves to show that calculations in the coord\SpecialChar \-

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{f}^{*},\mathbf{g}^{*}$
\end_inset

 in order to make the solution shorter.
 Without these constraints, there are many more cases to be considered.)
 The coordinate-free approach does not necessarily provide a shorter way
 to find eigenvalues of matrices than the usual methods based on the evaluation
 of determinants.
 However, the coordinate-free method is efficient for the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 The end result is that we are able to determine eigenvalues and eigenspaces
 of operators such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

, regardless of the number of dimensions in the space, by using the special
 structure of these operators, which is specified in a purely geometric
 way.

 In case you have trouble with this formula, let me translate: The operator

 is by definition such that it will transform an arbitrary covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\in W^{*}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$

 The formula says that the value of that linear function applied to an arbitrary
 vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 should be equal to the number 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\hat{A}\mathbf{v})$

 the parentheses are used to show that the first object is acting on the

Since we have defined the covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{T}\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 for any

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{T}$
\end_inset

 acting in the space 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{*}$

 and yielding a covector from 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$

 Please read the formula again and check that you can understand it.
 The difficulty of understanding equations such as Eq.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_layout Standard
In order to use this definition, we need to apply

\end_inset

 to an arbitrary vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transpose operator 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}$
\end_inset

 maps 
\begin_inset Formula $W^{*}\rightarrow V^{*}$

\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}=\sum_{k}\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}\otimes\mathbf{w}_{k}\in V^{*}\otimes W$
\end_inset

 Its tensor representation consists of the same vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}_{k}\in W$

\begin_layout Standard
The rank of

\end_inset

 is the smallest number of terms necessary to write an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}:V\rightarrow W$
\end_inset

 as a sum of single-term tensor products.
 In other words, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}=\sum_{k=1}^{\textrm{rank }\hat{A}}\mathbf{w}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}\in W\otimes V^{*},\]

with suitably chosen 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}_{k}\in W$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}\in V^{*}$
\end_inset

, but not as a sum of fewer terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 can be written as a sum of tensor product terms,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\hat{A}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathbf{w}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*},\label{eq:sum A wf1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}_{k}\in W$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}\in V^{*}$
\end_inset

 are 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 vectors and covectors, and 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 integer.
 There are many possible choices of these vectors and the covectors.
 Let us suppose that Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:sum A wf1}

\end_inset

) represents a choice such that 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the smallest possible number of terms.
 We will first show that 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is not smaller than the rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

; then we will show that 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is not larger than the rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is the smallest number of terms, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{w}_{1},...,\mathbf{w}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 must be linearly independent, or else we can reduce the number of terms
 in the sum\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:sum A wf1}

\end_inset

).
 To show this, suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is equal to a linear combination of other 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}_{k}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{w}_{1}=\sum_{k=2}^{n}\lambda_{k}\mathbf{w}_{k},\]

\end_inset

then we can rewrite 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}=\mathbf{w}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{1}^{*}+\sum_{k=2}^{n}\mathbf{w}_{k}\otimes\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}=\sum_{k=2}^{n}\mathbf{w}_{k}\otimes\left(\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}+\lambda_{k}\mathbf{f}_{1}^{*}\right),\]

\end_inset

reducing the number of terms from 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

.
 Since by assumption the number of terms cannot be made less than 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{w}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 must be linearly independent.
 In particular, the subspace spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{w}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al.
 (The same reasoning shows that the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 must be also linearly independent, but we will not need to use this.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is the dimension of the image of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

; let us denote 
\begin_inset Formula $m\equiv\text{rank }\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 It follows from the definition of the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 that for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

, the image 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}_{k}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}\mathbf{v}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)\mathbf{w}_{k}.\]

\end_inset

Therefore, the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

-dimensional subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{im}\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is contained within the 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Span}\left\{ \mathbf{w}_{1},...,\mathbf{w}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $m\leq n$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now, we may choose a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{b}_{1},...,\mathbf{b}_{m}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{im}\hat{A}$
\end_inset

; then for every 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}\mathbf{v}=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\beta_{i}\mathbf{b}_{i}\]

\end_inset

with some coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}$
\end_inset

 that are uniquely determined for each vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

; in other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}$
\end_inset

 are 
\emph on
functions
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 It is easy to see that the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}$
\end_inset

 are 
\emph on
linear
\emph default
 functions of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 since
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}(\mathbf{v}+\lambda\mathbf{u})=\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\beta_{i}+\lambda\alpha_{i})\mathbf{b}_{i}\]

\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{u}=\sum_{i=1}^{m}\alpha_{i}\mathbf{b}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence there exist some covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{g}_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{i}=\mathbf{g}_{i}^{*}(\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

.
 It follows that we are able to express 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 as the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{m}\mathbf{b}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{g}_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

 using 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 terms.
 Since the smallest possible number of terms is 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $m\geq n$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $m\leq n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $m\geq n$

\begin_inset Formula $n=m=\textrm{rank }\hat{A}$

\begin_layout Standard
So far we have used a purely coordinate-free formalism to define and describe
 tensors from spaces such as 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 However, in many calculations a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is fixed, and one needs to compute the components of tensors in that basis.
 Also, the coordinate-free notation becomes cumbersome for computations
 in higher-rank tensor spaces such as 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V\otimes V^{*}$
\end_inset

 because there is no direct means of referring to an individual component
 in the tensor product.
 The 
\series bold

\series default
 makes such calculations easier.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is fixed; then the dual basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{k}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is also fixed.
 Any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 is decomposed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=\sum_{k}v_{k}\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

 and any covector as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}=\sum_{k}f_{k}\mathbf{e}_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Any tensor from 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V$
\end_inset

 is decomposed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=\sum_{j,k}A_{jk}\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{k}\in V\otimes V\]

\end_inset

and so on.
 The action of a covector on a vector is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)=\sum_{k}f_{k}v_{k}$
\end_inset

, and the action of an operator on a vector is 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j,k}A_{jk}v_{k}\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 However, it is cumbersome to keep writing these sums.
 In the index notation, one writes 
\emph on
only
\emph default
 the components 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{k}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{jk}$
\end_inset

 of vectors and tensors.

Basis vectors

 (It is assumed that the basis is fixed and known.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Instead of a vector

 Covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\in V^{*}$

 are written 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{k}$
\end_inset

 with the 
\emph on
subscript
\emph default
 index.
 The index 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 runs over integers from 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 Components of vectors and tensors may be thought of as numbers (e.g.\InsetSpace ~
elements

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tensors are written as multidimen\SpecialChar \-

\begin_inset Formula $A_{jk}\in V^{*}\otimes V^{*}$

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{k}^{lm}\in V\otimes V\otimes V^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus e.g.\InsetSpace ~
the Kronecker delta symbol is written as 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{k}^{j}$
\end_inset

 when it represents the identity operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{1}_{V}$

The choice of indices must be consistent; each index corresponds to a particular

\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}=u_{k}$

\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}+u^{i}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Correct equations are 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}=u_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{i}+u^{i}=0$

 This disallows meaningless expressions such as

\end_inset

 (one cannot add vectors from different spaces).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Sums over indices such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k=1}^{N}a_{k}b_{k}$

\begin_inset Formula $A_{k}^{j}v^{k}$

\begin_layout Itemize
Summation is allowed

 This corresponds to requiring that we are only allowed to compute the canonical
 pairing of

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

 [see Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:f star v}

 The expression 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{k}v^{k}$
\end_inset

 is not allowed because there is no canonical pairing of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, so, for instance, the sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k=1}^{N}v^{k}v^{k}$
\end_inset

 depends on the choice of the basis.
 For the same reason (dependence on the basis), expressions such as 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{i}v^{i}w^{i}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ii}B^{ii}$
\end_inset

 are not allowed.
 Correct expressions are

 The rank of a tensor expression is equal to the number of free subscript

 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{k}^{j}v^{k}$
\end_inset

 is a rank 
\begin_inset Formula $1$

a vector) because the expression

\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is implied.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The tensor product symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\otimes$
\end_inset

 For example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{f}^{*}=\sum_{jk}v_{j}f_{k}^{*}\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{k}^{*}$
\end_inset

, one writes 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{k}f_{j}$
\end_inset

 to represent the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 The index letters in the expression

 are intentionally chosen to be 
\emph on
different
\emph default

\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

) so that no summation would be implied.
 In other words, a tensor product is written simply as a product of components,
 and the index letters are chosen appropriately.
 Then one can interpret 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{k}f_{j}$
\end_inset

 as simply the product of 
\emph on

 In particular, it makes no difference whether one writes 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{j}v^{k}$

 The

In this formula,

Question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I would like to decompose a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 using the index notation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=v^{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Is it okay to write the 
\emph on
lower
\emph default
 index 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 on the basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

? I also want to write 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{j}=\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}(\mathbf{v})$
\end_inset

 using the dual basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

, but then the index 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 is not correctly matched at both sides.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The index notation is designed so that you never use the basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}$
\end_inset

 --- you only use components such as 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{j}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 The only way to keep the upper and the lower indices consistent (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
having
 the summation always over one upper and one lower index) when you want
 to use both the components 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{j}$
\end_inset

 and the basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

 is to use 
\emph on
upper
\emph default
 indices on the dual basis, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
writing 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}^{*j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Then a covector will have components with lower indices, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}=f_{j}\mathbf{e}^{*j}$
\end_inset

, and the index notation remains consistent.
 A further problem occurs when you have a scalar product and you would like
 to express the component 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{j}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{j}=\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{e}_{j}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 In this case, the only way to keep the notation consistent is to use explicitly
 a suitable matrix, say 
\begin_inset Formula $g^{ij}$
\end_inset

, in order to represent the scalar product.
 Then one would be able to write 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{j}=g^{jk}\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{e}_{k}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and keep the index notation consistent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Advantages and disadvantages of index notation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Index notation is conceptually easier than the index-free notation because
 one can imagine manipulating 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

merely
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 some tables of numbers, rather than 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

abstract vectors.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In other words, we are working with less abstract objects.
 The price is that we obscure the geometric interpretation of what we are
 doing, and proofs of general theorems become more difficult to understand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main advantage of the index notation is that it makes computations with
 complicated tensors quicker.
 Consider, for example, the space 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V\otimes V^{*}\otimes V^{*}$
\end_inset

 whose elements can be interpreted as operators from 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Hom}\,(V\otimes V,V\otimes V)$
\end_inset

.
 The action of such an operator on a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{jk}\in V\otimes V$
\end_inset

 is expressed in the index notation as
\begin_inset Formula \[
b^{lm}=A_{jk}^{lm}a^{jk},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{lm}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{lm}$
\end_inset

 represent tensors from 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{jk}^{lm}$
\end_inset

 is a tensor from 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V\otimes V^{*}\otimes V^{*}$
\end_inset

, while the summation over the indices 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is implied.
 Each index letter refers unambiguously to one tensor product factor.
 Note that the formula 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b^{lm}=A_{kj}^{lm}a^{jk}\]

\end_inset

describes another (
\emph on
inequivalent
\emph default
) way to define the isomorphism between the spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V\otimes V^{*}\otimes V^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Hom}\,(V\otimes V,V\otimes V)$
\end_inset

.
 The index notation expresses this difference in a concise way; of course,
 one needs to pay close attention to the position and the order of indices.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that in the coordinate-free notation it is much more cumbersome to
 describe and manipulate such tensors.
 Without the index notation, it is cumbersome to perform calculations with
 a tensor such as
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{jl}^{ik}\equiv\delta_{j}^{i}\delta_{l}^{k}-\delta_{j}^{k}\delta_{l}^{i}\in V\otimes V\otimes V^{*}\otimes V^{*}\]

\end_inset

 which acts as an operator in 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V$
\end_inset

, exchanging the two vector factors:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\delta_{j}^{i}\delta_{l}^{k}-\delta_{j}^{k}\delta_{l}^{i}\right)a^{jl}=a^{ik}-a^{ki}.\]

\end_inset

The index-free definition of this operator is simple with single-term tensor
 products,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{B}\left(\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{v}\right)\equiv\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{u}.\]

\end_inset

Having defined 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 on single-term tensor products, we require linearity and so define the
 operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 on the entire space 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V$
\end_inset

.
 However, practical calculations are cumbersome if we are applying 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 to a complicated tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $X\in V\otimes V$
\end_inset

 rather than to a single-term product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, because, in particular, we are obliged to decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 into single-term tensor products in order to perform such a calculation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some 
\emph on
disadvantages
\emph default
 of the index notation are as follows: (1) If the basis is changed, all
 components need to be recomputed.
 In textbooks that use the index notation, quite some time is spent studying
 the transformation laws of tensor components under a change of basis.
 If different bases are used simultaneously, confusion may result as to
 which basis is implied in a particular formula.
 (2) If we are using unrelated vector spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $W$
\end_inset

, we need to choose a basis in each of them and always remember which index
 belongs to which space.
 The index notation does not show this explicitly.
 To alleviate this problem, one may use e.g.\InsetSpace ~
Greek and Latin indices to distinguish
 different spaces, but this is not always convenient or sufficient.
 (3) The geometrical meaning of many calculations appears hidden behind
 a mass of indices.
 It is sometimes unclear whether a long expression with indices can be simplifie
d and how to proceed with calculations.
 (Do we need to try all possible relabellings of indices and see what happens?)
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Despite these disadvantages, the index notation enables one to perform practical
 calculations with high-rank tensor spaces, such as those required in field
 theory and in general relativity.
 For this reason, and also for historical reasons (Einstein used the index
 notation when developing the theory of relativity), most physics textbooks
 use the index notation.
 In some cases, calculations can be performed equally quickly using index
 and index-free notations.
 In other cases, especially when deriving general properties of tensors,
 the index-free notation is superior.
\begin_inset Foot

 are not essential for this book's central topics.
 However, I will occasionally show how to do some calculations also in the
 index notation.

\begin_layout Subsection
Advantages and disadvantages of Dirac notation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Dirac notation is convenient when many calculations with vectors and
 covectors are required.
 But calculations become cumbersome if we need many tensor powers.
 For example, suppose we would like to apply a covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle f\right|$
\end_inset

 to the 
\emph on
second
\emph default
 vector in the tensor product 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a\right\rangle \left|b\right\rangle \left|c\right\rangle $
\end_inset

, so that the answer is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a\right\rangle \langle f\left|b\right\rangle \left|c\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Now one cannot simply write 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle f\right|X$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $X=\left|a\right\rangle \left|b\right\rangle \left|c\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle f\right|X$
\end_inset

 is ambiguous in this case.
 The desired kind of action of covectors on tensors is difficult to express
 using the Dirac notation.
 Only the index notation allows one to write and to carry out arbitrary
 operations with this kind of tensor product.
 In the example just mentioned, one writes 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{j}a^{i}b^{j}c^{k}$
\end_inset

 to indicate that the covector 
\begin_inset Formula $f_{j}$
\end_inset

 acts on the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $b^{j}$
\end_inset

 but not on the other vectors.
 Of course, the resulting expression is harder to read because one needs
 to pay close attention to every index.

 The basic idea of the exterior product is that we would like to define

 In other words, we would like to have the properties

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here I discuss, at some length, the motivation for introducing the exterior
 product.
 The motivation is geometrical and comes from considering the properties
 of areas and volumes in the framework of elementary Euclidean geometry.
 I will proceed with a formal definition of the exterior product in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Definition-of-the-exterior}

\end_inset

.
 In order to understand the definition explained there, it is not necessary
 to use this geometric motivation because the definition will be purely
 algebraic.
 Nevertheless, I feel that this motivation will be helpful for some readers.

\begin_layout Standard
We work in a two-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al Euclidean space, such as that considered in
 elementary geometry.
 We assume that the usual geometrical definition of the area of a parallelogram
 is known.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the area 
\begin_inset Formula $Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

 of a parallelogram spanned by vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 It is known from elementary geometry that 
\begin_inset Formula $Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})=\left|\mathbf{a}\right|\cdot\left|\mathbf{b}\right|\cdot\sin\alpha$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is the angle between the two vectors, which is always between 0 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\pi$
\end_inset

 (we do not take into account the orientation of this angle).
 Thus defined, the area 
\begin_inset Formula $Ar$
\end_inset

 is always non-negative.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us investigate 
\begin_inset Formula $Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

 as a function of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 If we stretch the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

, say, by factor 2, the area is also increased by factor 2.
 However, if we multiply 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 by the number 
\begin_inset Formula $-2$
\end_inset

, the area will be multiplied by 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 rather than by 
\begin_inset Formula $-2$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
Ar(\mathbf{a},2\mathbf{b})=Ar(\mathbf{a},-2\mathbf{b})=2Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}).\]

\end_inset

 Similarly, for some vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 such as shown in Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:The-area-of2}

\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c})=Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})+Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c})$
\end_inset

.
 However, if we consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}=-\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 then we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}) & =Ar(\mathbf{a},0)=0\\
 & \neq Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})+Ar(\mathbf{a},-\mathbf{b})=2Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}).\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Hence, the area 
\begin_inset Formula $Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

 is, strictly speaking, 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 a linear function of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
Ar(\lambda\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) & =\left|\lambda\right|Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\neq\lambda\, Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}),\\
Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}) & \neq Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})+Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{c}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Nevertheless, as we have seen, the properties of linearity hold in 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 cases.
 If we look closely at those cases, we find that linearly holds precisely
 when we do not change the orientation of the vectors.
 It would be more convenient if the linearity properties held in all cases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The trick is to replace the area function 
\begin_inset Formula $Ar$
\end_inset

oriented area
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{oriented area}

 function 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$

\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
A(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})=\pm\left|\mathbf{a}\right|\cdot\left|\mathbf{b}\right|\cdot\sin\alpha,\]

\end_inset

Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first property is a straightforward consequence of the sign rule in
 the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Proving the second property requires considering the cases 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda>0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda<0$
\end_inset

 separately.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda>0$
\end_inset

 then the orientation of the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right)$
\end_inset

 remains the same and then it is clear that the property holds: When we
 rescale 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, the parallelogram is stretched and its area increases by factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda<0$
\end_inset

 then the orientation of the parallelogram is reversed and the oriented
 area changes sign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To prove the sum law, we consider  two cases: either 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 is parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 or it is not.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 is parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

, say 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}=\alpha\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

, we use Fig.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{fig:The-area-of1}

\end_inset

 to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}+\lambda\mathbf{a})=A(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

, which yields the desired statement since 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{a},\lambda\mathbf{a})=0$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 is not parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
It is relatively easy to compute the oriented area because of its algebraic
 properties.
 Suppose the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 are given through their components in a standard basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

, for instance 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}=\alpha_{1}\mathbf{e}_{1}+\alpha_{2}\mathbf{e}_{2},\quad\mathbf{b}=\beta_{1}\mathbf{e}_{1}+\beta_{2}\mathbf{e}_{2}.\]

\end_inset

We assume, of course, that the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

 are orthogonal to each other and have unit length, as is appropriate in
 a Euclidean space.
 We also assume that the right angle is measured from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

 in the counter-clockwise direction, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2})=+1$
\end_inset

.
 Then we use the Statement and the properties 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{1})=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2})=1$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{2})=0$
\end_inset

 to compute
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
A(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}) & =A(\alpha_{1}\mathbf{e}_{1}+\alpha_{2}\mathbf{e}_{2},\beta_{1}\mathbf{e}_{1}+\beta_{2}\mathbf{e}_{2})\\
 & =\alpha_{1}\beta_{2}A(\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2})+\alpha_{2}\beta_{1}A(\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{1})\\
 & =\alpha_{1}\beta_{2}-\alpha_{2}\beta_{1}.\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The ordinary (unoriented) area is then obtained as the absolute value of
 the oriented area, 
\begin_inset Formula $Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})=\left|A(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\right|$
\end_inset

.
 It turns out that the oriented area, due to its strict linearity properties,
 is a much more convenient and powerful construction than the unoriented
 area.

The projection onto the coordinate plane of

 It is then straightforward to see that all the properties of the oriented

It is therefore convenient to consider the oriented areas of the three projectio

 Indeed, it can be shown that these three projected areas coincide with
 the three Euclidean components of the vector product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}$

 The vector product is the traditional way such areas are represented in
 geometry: the vector

 represents at once the magnitude of the area and the orientation of the
 parallelogram.
 One computes the unoriented area of a parallelogram as the length of the

 representing the oriented area,
\begin_inset Formula \[
Ar(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})=\left[A(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})_{\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2}}^{2}+A(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})_{\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{3}}^{2}+A(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})_{\mathbf{e}_{3},\mathbf{e}_{1}}^{2}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}.\]

 Luckily, the vector product does not play an essential role in the construction

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of working with the vector product, we will generalize the idea

 Consider a parallelogram spanned by vectors

\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 with the standard basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 While in three-dimen\SpecialChar \-

 coordinate planes 
\begin_inset Formula $xy$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $xz$

\begin_inset Formula $yz$
\end_inset

), in an

\end_inset

-dimen\SpecialChar \-

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$
\end_inset

 coordinate planes, which can be denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Span}\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{i},\mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $1\leq i<j\leq n$
\end_inset

).
 We may construct the 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$
\end_inset

 projections of the parallelogram onto these coordinate planes.
 Each of these projections has an oriented area; that area is a bilinear,
 antisymmetric number-valued function of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 (The proof of the Statement above does not use the fact that the space

\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)$

 the parallelogram.
 It is clear that all these components are needed in order to describe the

\begin_layout Standard
The analogy between ordinary vectors and vector-val\SpecialChar \-

 visually as follows.
 A straight line segment in an

\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 projections of the line segment onto the coordinate axes.
 (The components are

 to the orientation of the axis.) The length of a straight line segment,
 i.e.\InsetSpace ~
the length of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

, is then computed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}\right\rangle }$
\end_inset

.
 The scalar product 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is equal to the sum of squared lengths of the projections because we are
 using an orthonormal basis.
 A parallelogram in space is represented by a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$

\end_inset

 belongs to the space of oriented areas, not to the original 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

 is then computed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\left\langle \psi,\psi\right\rangle }$

 The scalar product 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \psi,\psi\right\rangle $

In the previous section I motivated the introduction of the antisymmetric

 In this section I will give the definition and work out the properties
 of the exterior product in a purely algebraic manner, without using any

 This will enable us to work with vectors in arbitrary dimensions, to obtain
 many useful results, and eventually also to appreciate more fully the geometric

As explained in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Area-of-two-dimensional-parallelograms}

\begin_layout Standard
In three dimensions, an oriented area is represented by the cross product

and all linear combinations of such tensors.
 The exterior product of two vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$

\begin_layout Standard
For example, here is one particular element from 
\begin_inset Formula $V\wedge V$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}

\begin_layout Standard
It is quite cumbersome to perform calculations in the tensor product notation
 as we did in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:uvw calc 1}

\end_inset

).
 So let us write the exterior product as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 It is then straightforward to see that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

wedge

\begin_inset Formula $\wedge$
\end_inset

 indeed works like an anti-commutative multiplication, as we intended.
 The rules of computation are summarized in the following statement.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement 1:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One may save time and write 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{u}\equiv\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\in V\wedge V$
\end_inset

, and the result of any calculation will be correct, as long as one follows
 the rules:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v} & =-\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{u},\label{eq:uv antisymm}\\
\left(\lambda\mathbf{u}\right)\wedge\mathbf{v} & =\lambda\left(\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\right),\\
\left(\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}\right)\wedge\mathbf{x} & =\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{x}.\label{eq:uv distrib}\end{align}

\end_inset

It follows also that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\wedge\left(\lambda\mathbf{v}\right)=\lambda\left(\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\right)$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

.
 (These identities hold for any vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 and any scalars 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These properties are direct consequences of the axioms of the tensor product
 when applied to antisymmetric tensors.
 For example, the calculation\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:uvw calc 1}

\end_inset

) now requires a simple expansion of brackets,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{v}\right)\wedge\left(\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{w}\right)=\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{w}+\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{w}.\]

\end_inset

Here we removed the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 which vanishes due to the antisymmetry of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge$
\end_inset

.
 Details left as exercise.

and linear combinations of such tensors.
 These tensors are called

\begin_layout Standard
How to compute expressions containing multiple products such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Apply the rules shown in Statement\InsetSpace ~
1.
 For example, one can permute adjacent vectors and change sign,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}=-\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{c}=\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}\wedge\mathbf{a},\]

\end_inset

one can expand brackets,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}\wedge(\mathbf{x}+4\mathbf{y})\wedge\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{b}+4\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{y}\wedge\mathbf{b},\]

\end_inset

and so on.
 If the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 are given as linear combinations of some basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, we can thus reduce 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 to a linear combination of exterior products of basis vectors, such as
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{4}$
\end_inset

, etc.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 suggests that the exterior product is associative,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}=\left(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\right)\wedge\mathbf{c}=\mathbf{a}\wedge(\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}).\]

\end_inset

How can we make sense of this?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we want to be pedantic, we need to define the exterior product operation
 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge$
\end_inset

 between a single-term bivector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 and a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

, such that the result is 
\emph on
by
\emph default
 
\emph on
definition
\emph default
 the 3-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

.
 We then define the same operation on linear combinations of single-term
 bivectors, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}\right)\wedge\mathbf{c}\equiv\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}\wedge\mathbf{c}.\]

\end_inset

Thus we have defined the exterior product between 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{2}V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, the result being a 3-vector from 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{3}V$
\end_inset

.
 We then need to verify that the results do not depend on the choice of
 the vectors such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 in the representation of a bivector: A different representation can be
 achieved only by using the properties of the exterior product (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
the axioms
 of the tensor product), e.g.\InsetSpace ~
we may replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $-\mathbf{b}\wedge\left(\mathbf{a}+\lambda\mathbf{b}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 It is easy to verify that any such replacements will not modify the resulting
 3-vector, e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}=-\mathbf{b}\wedge\left(\mathbf{a}+\lambda\mathbf{b}\right)\wedge\mathbf{c},\]

\end_inset

again due to the properties of the exterior product.
 This consideration shows that calculations with exterior products are consisten
t with our algebraic intuition.
 We may indeed compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\right)\wedge\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 or as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\left(\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}$

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}=\left(2,-2,0\right)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}=\left(-2,5,-3\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Let us compute various exterior products.
 Calculations are easier if we introduce the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

 explicitly:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{e}_{2}-\mathbf{e}_{3}\right),\quad\mathbf{b}=2(\mathbf{e}_{1}-\mathbf{e}_{2}),\quad\mathbf{c}=-2\mathbf{e}_{1}+5\mathbf{e}_{2}-3\mathbf{e}_{3}.\]

\end_inset

We compute the 2-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 by using the properties of the exterior product, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{x}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}=-\mathbf{y}\wedge\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, and simply expanding the brackets as usual in algebra:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b} & =\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbf{e}_{2}-\mathbf{e}_{3}\right)\wedge2\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}-\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\\
 & =\left(\mathbf{e}_{2}-\mathbf{e}_{3}\right)\wedge\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}-\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\\
 & =\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}-\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}-\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\\
 & =-\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}-\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}.\end{align*}

The last expression is the result; note that now there is nothing more to
 compute or to simplify.
 The expressions such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

 are the basic expressions out of which the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}\wedge\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

 is built.
 Below (Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Properties-of-the-ext-powers}

\end_inset

) we will show formally that the set of these expressions is a basis in
 the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{3}\wedge\mathbb{R}^{3}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us also compute the 3-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}=\left(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\right)\wedge\mathbf{c}\\
 & =\left(-\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}-\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}\right)\wedge(-2\mathbf{e}_{1}+5\mathbf{e}_{2}-3\mathbf{e}_{3}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

When we expand the brackets here, terms such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 will vanish because 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}=-\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}=0,\]

\end_inset

so only terms containing all different vectors need to be kept, and we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c} & =3\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}+5\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}+2\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}\\
 & =\left(3-5+2\right)\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}=0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

We note that all the terms are proportional to the 3-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}$
\end_inset

, so only the coefficient in front of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}$
\end_inset

 was needed; then, by coincidence, that coefficient turned out to be zero.
 So the result is the zero 3-vector.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our original goal was to introduce a bilinear, antisymmetric product of
 vectors in order to obtain a geometric representation of oriented areas.
 Instead, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 was defined algebraically, through tensor products.
 It is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is antisymmetric and bilinear, but why does it represent an oriented area?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, it may not be immediately clear why oriented areas should be elements
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $V\wedge V$
\end_inset

.
 We have seen that the oriented area 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

 is an antisymmetric and bilinear function of the two vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

.
 Right now we have constructed the space 
\begin_inset Formula $V\wedge V$
\end_inset

 simply as the 
\emph on
space of antisymmetric products
\emph default
.
 By constructing that space merely out of the axioms of the antisymmetric
 product, we already covered 
\emph on
every
\emph default
 
\emph on
possible
\emph default
 bilinear antisymmetric product.
 This means that 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 antisymmetric and bilinear function of the two vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 or, more generally, is a 
\emph on
linear
\emph default
 
\emph on
function
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 (perhaps with values in a different space).
 Therefore, the space of oriented areas (that is, the space of linear combinatio
ns of 
\begin_inset Formula $A(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

 for various 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

) is in any case mapped to a subspace of 
\begin_inset Formula $V\wedge V$
\end_inset

.
 We have also seen that oriented areas in 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 dimensions can be represented through 
\begin_inset Formula ${N \choose 2}$
\end_inset

 projections, which indicates that they are vectors in some 
\begin_inset Formula ${N \choose 2}$
\end_inset

-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al space.
 We will see below that the space 
\begin_inset Formula $V\wedge V$
\end_inset

 has exactly this dimension (Theorem\InsetSpace ~
2 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Properties-of-the-ext-powers}

\end_inset

).
 Therefore, we can expect that the space of oriented areas coincides with
 
\begin_inset Formula $V\wedge V$
\end_inset

.
 Below we will be working in a space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 with a scalar product, where the notions of area and volume are well defined.
 Then we will see (Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Volumes-of-k-dimensional}

\end_inset

) that tensors from 
\begin_inset Formula $V\wedge V$
\end_inset

 and the higher exterior powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 indeed correspond in a natural way to oriented areas, or more generally
 to oriented volumes of a certain dimension.

\begin_layout Standard
The construction of the exterior product
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{exterior product!origin of the name}

\end_inset

 is a modern formulation of the ideas dating back to H.
 Grassmann (1844).
 A 2-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is interpreted geometrically as the oriented area of the parallelogram
 spanned by the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, a 3-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 represents the oriented 3-volume of a parallelepiped spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Due to the antisymmetry of the exterior product, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b})\wedge(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{c})=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c})\wedge(\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{d})=0$
\end_inset

, etc.
 We can interpret this geometrically by saying that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

product
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of two volumes is zero if these volumes have a vector in common.
 This motivated Grassmann to call his antisymmetric product 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

exterior.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 In his reasoning, the product of two 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

extensive quantities
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 (such as lines, areas, or volumes) is nonzero only when each of the two
 quantities is geometrically

Where is the star here, really? Is the space

\end_inset

 different from 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\wedge^{n}V\right)^{*}$
\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Good that you asked.
 These spaces are canonically isomorphic, but there is a subtle technical
 issue worth mentioning.
 Consider an example: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{*}\wedge\mathbf{b}^{*}\in\wedge^{2}(V^{*})$
\end_inset

 can act upon 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\in\wedge^{2}V$
\end_inset

 by the standard tensor product rule, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{*}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}$
\end_inset

 acts on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\mathbf{a}^{*}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)\left(\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{v}\right)=\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{u})\,\mathbf{b}^{*}(\mathbf{v}),\]

\end_inset

so by using the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{*}\wedge\mathbf{b}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 through the tensor product, we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(\mathbf{a}^{*}\wedge\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)\left(\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\right) & =\left(\mathbf{a}^{*}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}-\mathbf{b}^{*}\otimes\mathbf{a}^{*}\right)\left(\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{v}-\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{u}\right)\\
 & =2\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{u})\,\mathbf{b}^{*}(\mathbf{v})-2\mathbf{b}^{*}(\mathbf{u})\,\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{v}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

We got a 
\series bold
combinatorial
\series default
 
\series bold
factor
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{combinatorial factor}

\end_inset

 2, that is, a factor that arises because we have 
\emph on
two
\emph default
 permutations of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 With 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{n}\left(V^{*}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\wedge^{n}V\right)^{*}$
\end_inset

 we get a factor 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

.
 It is not always convenient to have this combinatorial factor.
 For example, in a finite number field the number 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 might be 
\emph on
equal to zero
\emph default
 for large enough 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 In these cases we could 
\emph on
redefine
\emph default
 the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{*}\wedge\mathbf{b}^{*}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\mathbf{a}^{*}\wedge\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)\left(\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\right)\equiv\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{u})\,\mathbf{b}^{*}(\mathbf{v})-\mathbf{b}^{*}(\mathbf{u})\,\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{v}).\]

\end_inset

 If we are not working in a finite number field, we are able to divide by
 any integer, so we may keep combinatorial factors in the denominators of
 expressions where such factors appear.
 For example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

 is the corresponding basis tensor in the one-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al space 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

, the dual basis tensor in 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\wedge^{N}V\right)^{*}$
\end_inset

 could be defined by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega^{*}=\frac{1}{N!}\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}^{*},\quad\text{so that}\:\omega^{*}(\omega)=1.\]

\end_inset

The need for such combinatorial factors is a minor technical inconvenience
 that does not arise too often.
 We may give the following definition that avoids dividing by combinatorial
 factors (but now we use permutations; see Appendix\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Properties-of-permutations}

\begin_layout Standard
At this point it is still unclear why the antisymmetric definition is at

 Perhaps we could define something else, say the symmetric product, instead
 of the exterior product? We could try to define a product, say 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\odot\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}\odot\mathbf{b}=2\mathbf{b}\odot\mathbf{a}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This does not work because, for example, we would have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{b}\odot\mathbf{a}=2\mathbf{a}\odot\mathbf{b}=4\mathbf{b}\odot\mathbf{a},\]

\begin_layout Standard
The antisymmetric tensor product is the eigenspace (within

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{T}$
\end_inset

 with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $-1$
\end_inset

.
 That operator has only eigenvectors with eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

, so the only other possibility is to consider the eigenspace with eigenvalue
 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

.
 This eigenspace is spanned by symmetric tensors of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\otimes\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, and can be considered as the space of symmetric tensor products.
 We could write
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}\otimes_{S}\mathbf{b}\equiv\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{b}\otimes\mathbf{a}\]

\end_inset

and develop the properties of this product.
 However, it turns out that the symmetric tensor product is much less useful
 for the purposes of linear algebra than the antisymmetric subspace.

 can be written in this way simply by expressing every vector through the
 basis and by expanding the exterior products.
 The result will be a linear combination of the form shown above, containing
 at most 
\begin_inset Formula $N+1$
\end_inset

 single-term exterior products of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N+1}$
\end_inset

, and so on.
 We do not yet know whether these single-term exterior products constitute
 a linearly independent set; this will be established in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Properties-of-the-ext-powers}

\end_inset

.
 Presently, we will not need this property.

\begin_layout Standard
Now we would like to transform the expression above to a single term.
 We move 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{N+1}$
\end_inset

 outside brackets in the first 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 terms:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\omega & =\big(\alpha_{1}\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}+...+\alpha_{N}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N-1}\big)\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N+1}\\
 & \qquad+\alpha_{N+1}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}\\
 & \equiv\psi\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N+1}+\alpha_{N+1}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N},\end{align*}

\end_inset

where in the last line we have introduced an auxiliary 
\begin_inset Formula $(N-1)$
\end_inset

-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

.
 If it happens that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=0$
\end_inset

, there is nothing left to prove.
 Otherwise, at least one of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

 must be nonzero; without loss of generality, suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{N}\neq0$
\end_inset

 and rewrite 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega=\psi\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N+1}+\alpha_{N+1}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}=\psi\wedge\big(\mathbf{e}_{N+1}+\frac{\alpha_{N+1}}{\alpha_{N}}\mathbf{e}_{N}\big).\]

\end_inset

Now we note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 belongs to the space of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N-1\right)$
\end_inset

-vectors over the

-dimen\SpecialChar \-

al subspace spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 By the inductive assumption, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 can be written as a single-term exterior product, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{N-1}$
\end_inset

, of some vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Denoting 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}_{N}\equiv\mathbf{e}_{N+1}+\frac{\alpha_{N+1}}{\alpha_{N}}\mathbf{e}_{N},\]

\end_inset

we obtain 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega=\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{N-1}\wedge\mathbf{a}_{N},\]

\end_inset

i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 can be represented as a single-term exterior product.

\begin_layout Standard
Since the spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}V$
\end_inset

 are vector spaces, we may consider linear maps between them.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A simplest example is a map
\begin_inset Formula \[
L_{\mathbf{a}}:\omega\mapsto\mathbf{a}\wedge\omega,\]

\end_inset

mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}V\rightarrow\wedge^{k+1}V$
\end_inset

; here the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
fixed
\emph default
.
 It is important to check that 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathbf{a}}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\emph on
linear
\emph default
 map between these spaces.
 How do we check this? We need to check that 
\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathbf{a}}$
\end_inset

 maps a linear combination of tensors into linear combinations; this is
 easy to see,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
L_{\mathbf{a}} & (\omega+\lambda\omega^{\prime})=\mathbf{a}\wedge(\omega+\lambda\omega')\\
 & =\mathbf{a}\wedge\omega+\lambda\mathbf{a}\wedge\omega'=L_{\mathbf{a}}\omega+\lambda L_{\mathbf{a}}\omega'.\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now fix a covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 A covector is a map 
\begin_inset Formula $V\rightarrow\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

.
 In Lemma\InsetSpace ~
2 of Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Dimension-of-tensor}

\end_inset

 we have used covectors to define linear maps 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{*}:V\otimes W\rightarrow W$
\end_inset

 according to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:fg rule}

\end_inset

), mapping 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{w}\mapsto\mathbf{a}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

.
 Now we will apply the analogous construction to exterior powers and construct
 a map 
\begin_inset Formula $V\wedge V\rightarrow V$
\end_inset

.
 Let us denote this map by 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It would be incorrect to define the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}$
\end_inset

 by the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}(\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{w})=\mathbf{a}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

 because such a definition does not respect the antisymmetry of the wedge
 product and thus violates the linearity condition, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}\left(\mathbf{w}\wedge\mathbf{v}\right)\,{\lyxbuildrel!\above=}\,\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}\left(\left(-1\right)\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{w}\right)=-\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}\left(\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{w}\right)\neq\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{v})\mathbf{w}.\]

\end_inset

So we need to act with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{*}$
\end_inset

 on 
\emph on
each
\emph default
 of the vectors in a wedge product and make sure that the correct minus
 sign comes out.
 An acceptable formula for the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}:\wedge^{2}V\rightarrow V$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}\left(\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{w}\right)\equiv\mathbf{a}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)\mathbf{w}-\mathbf{a}^{*}\left(\mathbf{w}\right)\mathbf{v}.\]

\end_inset

(Please check that the linearity condition now holds!) This is how we will
 define the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{2}V$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now extend 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}:\wedge^{2}V\rightarrow V$
\end_inset

 to a map 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}:\wedge^{k}V\rightarrow\wedge^{k-1}V,\]

\end_inset

defined as follows: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}\mathbf{v} & \equiv\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{v}),\nonumber \\
\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}(\mathbf{v}\wedge\omega) & \equiv\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{v})\omega-\mathbf{v}\wedge(\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}\omega).\label{eq:inductive}\end{align}

\end_inset

This definition is 
\emph on
inductive
\emph default
, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
it shows how to define 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}V$
\end_inset

 if we know how to define it on 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k-1}V$
\end_inset

.
 The action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}$
\end_inset

 on a sum of terms is defined by requiring  linearity, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}\left(A+\lambda B\right)\equiv\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}\left(A\right)+\lambda\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}\left(B\right),\quad A,B\in\wedge^{k}V.\]

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
We can convert this inductive definition into a more explicit formula: if
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}\in\wedge^{k}V$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}} & (\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k})\equiv\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{v}_{1})\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}-\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{v}_{2})\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{3}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}\\

\begin_layout Standard
Let us check formally that the insertion map is linear.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The map 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}:\wedge^{k}V\rightarrow\wedge^{k-1}V$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq k\leq N$
\end_inset

 is a well-defined linear map, according to the inductive definition.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, we need to check that it maps linear combinations into linear combination
s; this is quite easy to see by induction, using the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{*}:V\rightarrow\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 is linear.
 However, this type of linearity is not sufficient; we also need to check
 that the 
\emph on
result
\emph default
 of the map, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}(\omega)$
\end_inset

, is defined 
\emph on
independently
\emph default
 
\emph on
of
\emph default
 
\emph on
the
\emph default
 
\emph on
representation
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 through vectors such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The problem is, there are many such representations, for example some tensor
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\wedge^{3}V$
\end_inset

 might be written using different vectors as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{3}=\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge(\mathbf{v}_{3}-\mathbf{v}_{1})\wedge(\mathbf{v}_{3}+\mathbf{v}_{2})\equiv\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{1}\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{2}\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{3}.\]

\end_inset

 We need to verify that any such equivalent representation yields the same
 resulting tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}(\omega)$
\end_inset

, despite the fact that the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
appears
\emph default
 to depend on the choice of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Only then will it be proved that 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}$
\end_inset

 is a linear map 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}V\rightarrow\wedge^{k-1}V$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An equivalent representation of a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 can be obtained only by using the properties of the exterior product, namely
 linearity and antisymmetry.
 Therefore, we need to verify that 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}(\omega)$
\end_inset

 does not change when we change the representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 in these two ways: 1) expanding a linear combination,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
(\mathbf{x}+\lambda\mathbf{y})\wedge...\mapsto\mathbf{x}\wedge...+\lambda\mathbf{y}\wedge...;\label{eq:change repr 1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

2) interchanging the order of two vectors in the exterior product and change
 the sign,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y}\wedge...\mapsto-\mathbf{y}\wedge\mathbf{x}\wedge...\label{eq:change repr 2}\end{equation}

\end_inset

It is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{x}+\lambda\mathbf{y})=\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{x})+\lambda\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{y})$
\end_inset

; it follows by induction that 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}\omega$
\end_inset

 does not change under a change of representation of the type\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:change repr 1}

\end_inset

).
 Now we consider the change of representation of the type\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:change repr 2}

\end_inset

).
 We have, by definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}(\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge\chi)=\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{v}_{1})\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge\chi-\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{v}_{2})\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\chi+\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}(\chi),\]

\end_inset

where we have denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\chi$
\end_inset

 the rest of the exterior product.
 It is clear from the above expression that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}(\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge\chi)=-\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}(\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\chi)=\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}(-\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\chi).\]

\end_inset

This proves that 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}(\omega)$
\end_inset

 does not change under a change of representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 of the type\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:change repr 2}

).
 This concludes the proof.

It is apparent from the proof that the

(

\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}$
\end_inset

 Indeed, if we attempt to define a map by a formula such as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\mapsto\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{v}_{1})\mathbf{v}_{2}+\mathbf{a}^{*}(\mathbf{v}_{2})\mathbf{v}_{1},\]

\end_inset

the result will 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 be a linear map 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{2}V\rightarrow V$
\end_inset

 despite the appearance of linearity.
 The correct formula must take into account the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}=-\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $L_{\mathbf{x}}\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}+\iota_{\mathbf{a}^{*}}L_{\mathbf{x}}:\wedge^{k}V\rightarrow\wedge^{k}V$

\begin_layout Standard
The exterior product is useful in many ways.
 One powerful property of the exterior product is its close relation to
 linear independence of sets of vectors.
 For example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}=\lambda\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

.
 More generally:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Theorem 1:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 of vectors from 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 is linearly independent if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $(\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k})\neq0$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
it is a nonzero tensor from 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}V$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly dependent then without loss of generality we may assume that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination of other vectors, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}=\sum_{j=2}^{k}\lambda_{j}\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k} & =\sum_{j=2}^{k}\lambda_{j}\mathbf{v}_{j}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{j}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}\\
 & =\sum_{j=2}^{k}\left(-1\right)^{j-1}\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\mathbf{v}_{j}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{j}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}=0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Conversely, we need to prove that the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}\neq0$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly 
\emph on
in
\emph default
dependent.
 The proof is by induction in 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

.
 The basis of induction is 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

: if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent then clearly 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 The induction step: Assume that the statement is proved for 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a linearly independent set.
 By Exercise\InsetSpace ~
1 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Dual-vector-space}

\end_inset

 there exists a covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\in V^{*}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}\right)=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}_{i}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $2\leq i\leq k$
\end_inset

.
 Now we apply the interior product map 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{f}^{*}}:\wedge^{k}V\rightarrow\wedge^{k-1}V$
\end_inset

 constructed in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Linear-maps-between-spaces}

\end_inset

 to the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 and find 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\iota_{\mathbf{f}^{*}}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}\right)=\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}.\]

\end_inset

By the induction step, the linear independence of 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

 vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{2},...,\mathbf{v}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 entails 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 The map 
\begin_inset Formula $\iota_{\mathbf{f}^{*}}$
\end_inset

 is linear and cannot map a zero tensor into a nonzero tensor, therefore

\begin_layout Standard
If

 then there is nothing to prove, so we assume 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\neq0$
\end_inset

 By definition, the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 has a representation as a sum of 
\emph on
several
\emph default
 exterior products, say 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}+\mathbf{v}_{1}^{\prime}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}^{\prime}+...\]

\end_inset

Let us simplify this expression to just one exterior product.
 First, let us omit any zero terms in this expression (for instance, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge...=0$
\end_inset

).
 Then by Theorem\InsetSpace ~
1 the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent (or else the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

 would be zero).
 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 All other vectors such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

 can be decomposed as linear combinations of vectors in that basis.
 Let us denote 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\equiv\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 By expanding the brackets in exterior products such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}^{\prime}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, we will obtain every time the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 with different coefficients.
 Therefore, the final result of simplification will be that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 equals  
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 multiplied with some coefficient.
 This is sufficient to prove Lemma\InsetSpace ~

If

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:uv antisymm}

 Now the induction step: assume that the statement is proved for

 Therefore the set

 By Theorem\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:All-bases-have}

\begin_layout Standard
The exterior product allows us to compute explicitly the dual basis
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{dual basis}

\end_inset

 for a given basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin with some motivation.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a given basis; we would like to compute its dual basis.
 For instance, the covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 of the dual basis is the linear function such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is equal to the coefficient at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 in the decomposition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{x}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}\mathbf{v}_{i};\quad\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}(\mathbf{x})=x_{1}.\]

\end_inset

We start from the observation that the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\equiv\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

 is nonzero since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis.
 The exterior product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

 is equal to zero if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination only of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

, with a zero coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 This suggests that the exterior product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 with the 
\begin_inset Formula $(N-1)$
\end_inset

-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

 is quite similar to the covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 we are looking for.
 Indeed, let us compute
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}=x_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}=x_{1}\omega.\]

\end_inset

Therefore, exterior multiplication with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

 acts quite similarly to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.

\end_inset

 denoted by a star: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
*\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}\right)\equiv\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

Then we can write 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}(\mathbf{x})\omega=\mathbf{x}\wedge*(\mathbf{v}_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 This equation can be used for computing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

: namely, for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in V$
\end_inset

 the number 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is equal to the constant 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 in the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge*(\mathbf{v}_{1})=\lambda\omega$
\end_inset

.
 To make this kind of equation more convenient, let us write
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lambda\equiv\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}}{\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}}=\frac{\mathbf{x}\wedge*(\mathbf{v}_{1})}{\omega},\]

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge*(\mathbf{v}_{1})$
\end_inset

; this tensor is proportional to the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 since both belong to the one-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-

\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

, so we can determine the number 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge*(\mathbf{v}_{1})=\lambda\omega$
\end_inset

; the proportionality coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is then the result of the division of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge*(\mathbf{v}_{1})$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{3}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}=x_{2}\omega=\mathbf{v}_{2}^{*}(\mathbf{x})\omega.\]

\end_inset

 If we would like to have 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}\omega=\mathbf{x}\wedge*(\mathbf{v}_{2})$
\end_inset

, we need to add an extra minus sign and define
\begin_inset Formula \[
*\left(\mathbf{v}_{2}\right)\equiv-\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{3}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}.\]

Then we indeed obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}^{*}(\mathbf{x})\omega=\mathbf{x}\wedge*(\mathbf{v}_{2})$

 The tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $*(\mathbf{v}_{i})$

\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The notation 
\begin_inset Formula $*(\mathbf{v}_{i})$
\end_inset

 suggests that e.g.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $*(\mathbf{v}_{1})$
\end_inset

 is some operation applied to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and is a function only of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

, but this is not so: The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of a vector depends on the entire basis and not merely on the single vector!
 Also, the property 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge*(\mathbf{v}_{1})=\omega$
\end_inset

 is not sufficient to define the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $*\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The proper definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $*(\mathbf{v}_{i})$
\end_inset

 is the tensor obtained from 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 by removing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 as just explained.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{2}$
\end_inset

, let us compute the dual basis to the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{v}_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}={2 \choose 1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}={-1 \choose 1}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

 the standard basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula ${1 \choose 0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula ${0 \choose 1}$
\end_inset

.
 We first compute the 2-vector 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}=\left(2\mathbf{e}_{1}+\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\wedge\left(-\mathbf{e}_{1}+\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)=3\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}.\]

\end_inset

 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

complement
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 operation for the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{v}_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 gives 
\begin_inset Formula $*(\mathbf{v}_{1})=\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $*(\mathbf{v}_{2})=-\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 We now define the covectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1,2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 by their action on arbitrary vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\equiv x_{1}\mathbf{e}_{1}+x_{2}\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}(\mathbf{x})\omega & =\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}=\left(x_{1}\mathbf{e}_{1}+x_{2}\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\wedge\left(-\mathbf{e}_{1}+\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\\
 & =\left(x_{1}+x_{2}\right)\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}=\frac{x_{1}+x_{2}}{3}\omega,\\
\mathbf{v}_{2}^{*}(\mathbf{x})\omega & =-\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{1}=-\left(x_{1}\mathbf{e}_{1}+x_{2}\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\wedge\left(2\mathbf{e}_{1}+\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\\
 & =\left(-x_{1}+2x_{2}\right)\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}=\frac{-x_{1}+2x_{2}}{3}\omega.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}^{*}=\frac{1}{3}\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}+\frac{1}{3}\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}^{*}=-\frac{1}{3}\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}+\frac{2}{3}\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can we define the complement operation for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in V$
\end_inset

 by the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge*(\mathbf{x})=\omega$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 is a fixed tensor? Does the complement really depend on the entire basis?
 Or perhaps a choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is sufficient?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
No, yes, no.
 Firstly, 
\begin_inset Formula $*(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

 is not uniquely specified by that equation alone, since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge A=\omega$
\end_inset

 defines 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 only up to tensors of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge...$
\end_inset

; secondly, the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\wedge*(\mathbf{x})=\omega$
\end_inset

 indicates that 
\begin_inset Formula $*(\lambda\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{\lambda}\,*\negmedspace(\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

, so the complement map would not be linear if defined like that.
 It is important to keep in mind that the complement map requires an entire
 basis for its definition and depends not only on the choice of a tensor
 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

, but also on the choice of all the basis vectors.
 For example, in two dimensions we have 
\begin_inset Formula $*(\mathbf{e}_{1})=\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

; it is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $*(\mathbf{e}_{1})$
\end_inset

 depends on the choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The situation is different when the vector space is equipped with a scalar
 product (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-vector-product}

\end_inset

 below).
 In that case, one usually chooses an 
\emph on
orthonormal
\emph default
 basis to define the complement map; then the complement map is called the
 
\series bold
Hodge
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Hodge star}

\end_inset

 star
\series default
.
 It turns out that the Hodge star is independent of the choice of the basis
 as long as the basis is orthonormal with respect to the given scalar product,
 and as long as the orientation of the basis is unchanged (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
as long as
 the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 does not change sign).
 In other words, the Hodge star operation is invariant under orthogonal
 and orientation-preserving transformations of the basis; these transformations
 preserve the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

.
 So the Hodge star operation depends not quite on the detailed choice of
 the basis, but rather on the choice of the scalar product and on the orientatio
n of the basis (the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

).
 However, right now we are working with a general space without a scalar
 product.
 In this case, the complement map depends on the entire basis.

\begin_layout Subsection
Gaussian elimination
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How much computational effort is actually needed to compute the exterior
 product of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 vectors? It looks easy in two or three dimensions, but in 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 dimensions the product of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{x}_{1},...,\mathbf{x}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 gives expressions such as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{x}_{n}=\left(x_{11}\mathbf{e}_{1}+...+x_{1N}\mathbf{e}_{N}\right)\wedge...\wedge\left(x_{n1}\mathbf{e}_{1}+...+x_{nN}\mathbf{e}_{N}\right),\]

\end_inset

which will be reduced to an exponentially large number (of order 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{n}$
\end_inset

) of elementary tensor products when we expand all brackets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Of course, expanding all brackets is not the best way to compute long exterior
 products.
 We can instead use a procedure similar to the Gaussian elimination
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Gaussian elimination}

\end_inset

 for computing determinants.
 The key observation is that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{x}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{x}_{2}\wedge...=\mathbf{x}_{1}\wedge\left(\mathbf{x}_{2}-\lambda\mathbf{x}_{1}\right)\wedge...\]

\end_inset

for any number 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, and that it is easy to compute an exterior product of the form
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\alpha_{1}\mathbf{e}_{1}+\alpha_{2}\mathbf{e}_{2}+\alpha_{3}\mathbf{e}_{3})\wedge(\beta_{2}\mathbf{e}_{2}+\beta_{3}\mathbf{e}_{3})\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}=\alpha_{1}\beta_{2}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}.\]

\end_inset

It is easy to compute this exterior product because the second vector (
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{2}\mathbf{e}_{2}+\beta_{3}\mathbf{e}_{3}$
\end_inset

) does not contain the basis vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and the third vector does not contain 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 So we can simplify the computation of a long exterior product if we rewrite
 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \bigwedge_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{x}_{n}=\mathbf{x}_{1}\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{n}\\
 & \equiv\mathbf{x}_{1}\wedge(\mathbf{x}_{2}-\lambda_{11}\mathbf{x}_{1})\wedge...\wedge\left(\mathbf{x}_{n}-\lambda_{n1}\mathbf{x}_{1}-...-\lambda_{n-1,n-1}\mathbf{x}_{n-1}\right),\end{align*}

\end_inset

where the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \lambda_{ij}\,|\,1\leq i\leq n-1,\;1\leq j\leq i\right\} $
\end_inset

 are chosen appropriately such that the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{2}\equiv\mathbf{x}_{2}-\lambda_{11}\mathbf{x}_{1}$
\end_inset

 does not contain the basis vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

, and generally the vector 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{k}\equiv\mathbf{x}_{k}-\lambda_{k1}\mathbf{x}_{1}-...-\lambda_{k-1,k-1}\mathbf{x}_{k-1}\]

\end_inset

 does not contain the basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

,..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k-1}$
\end_inset

.
 (That is, these basis vectors have been 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

eliminated
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 from the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{k}$
\end_inset

, hence the name of the method.) Eliminating 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{2}$
\end_inset

 can be done with 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{11}=\frac{x_{21}}{x_{11}}$
\end_inset

, which is possible provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{11}\neq0$
\end_inset

; if 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{11}=0$
\end_inset

, we need to renumber the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{x}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 If none of them contains 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

, we skip 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and proceed with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

 instead.
 Elimination of other basis vectors proceeds similarly.
 After performing this algorithm, we will either find that some vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{k}$
\end_inset

 is itself zero, which means that the entire exterior product vanishes,
 or we will find the product of vectors of the form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{n},\]

\end_inset

 where the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}$
\end_inset

 are linear combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{i}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}{}_{N}$
\end_inset

 (not containing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{i}$
\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $n=N$
\end_inset

, the product can be evaluated immediately since the last vector, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{N}$
\end_inset

, is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

, so
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{n} & =\left(c_{11}\mathbf{e}_{1}+...\right)\wedge...\wedge(c_{nn}\mathbf{e}_{N})\\
 & =c_{11}c_{22}...c_{nn}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

 The computation is somewhat longer if 
\begin_inset Formula $n<N$
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{n}=c_{nn}\mathbf{e}_{n}+...+c_{nN}\mathbf{e}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

In that case, we may eliminate, say, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{n}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{n-1}$
\end_inset

 by subtracting a multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{n}$
\end_inset

 from them, but we cannot simplify the product any more; at that point we
 need to expand the last bracket (containing 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{n}$
\end_inset

) and write out the terms.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example 1: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will calculate the exterior product
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}\\
 & \equiv(7\mathbf{e}_{1}-8\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{3})\wedge(\mathbf{e}_{1}-2\mathbf{e}_{2}-15\mathbf{e}_{3})\wedge(2\mathbf{e}_{1}-5\mathbf{e}_{2}-\mathbf{e}_{3}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

We will eliminate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 (just to keep the coefficients simpler):
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}=(\mathbf{a}-7\mathbf{b})\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge(\mathbf{c}-2\mathbf{b})\\
 & =(6\mathbf{e}_{2}+106\mathbf{e}_{3})\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge(-\mathbf{e}_{2}+9\mathbf{e}_{3})\\
 & \equiv\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}_{1}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Now we eliminate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}$
\end_inset

, and then the product can be evaluated quickly:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}=\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}_{1}=(\mathbf{a}_{1}+6\mathbf{c}_{1})\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}_{1}\\
 & =(160\mathbf{e}_{3})\wedge(\mathbf{e}_{1}-2\mathbf{e}_{2}-5\mathbf{e}_{3})\wedge(-\mathbf{e}_{2}+9\mathbf{e}_{3})\\
 & =160\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge(-\mathbf{e}_{2})=-160\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}.\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example 2:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}\equiv(\mathbf{e}_{1}+2\mathbf{e}_{2}-\mathbf{e}_{3}+\mathbf{e}_{4})\\
 & \quad\wedge(2\mathbf{e}_{1}+\mathbf{e}_{2}-\mathbf{e}_{3}+3\mathbf{e}_{4})\wedge(-\mathbf{e}_{1}-\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{4}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

We eliminate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}=\mathbf{a}\wedge(\mathbf{b}-2\mathbf{a})\wedge(\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{a})\\
 & =\mathbf{a}\wedge\left(-3\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{3}+\mathbf{e}_{4}\right)\wedge\left(\mathbf{e}_{2}-\mathbf{e}_{3}+2\mathbf{e}_{4}\right)\\
 & \equiv\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{c}_{1}=\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{1}\wedge(\mathbf{c}_{1}+3\mathbf{b}_{1})\\
 & =\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{1}\wedge(2\mathbf{e}_{3}+5\mathbf{e}_{4})\equiv\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{c}_{2}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

We can now eliminate 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{3}$
\end_inset

 from 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}_{1}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{c}_{2}=(\mathbf{a}+\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{c}_{2})\wedge(\mathbf{b}_{1}-\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{c}_{2})\wedge\mathbf{c}_{2}\equiv\mathbf{a}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{c}_{2}\\
 & =(\mathbf{e}_{1}+2\mathbf{e}_{2}+\frac{7}{2}\mathbf{e}_{4})\wedge(-3\mathbf{e}_{2}-\frac{3}{2}\mathbf{e}_{4})\wedge(2\mathbf{e}_{3}+5\mathbf{e}_{4}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Now we cannot eliminate any more vectors, so we expand the last bracket
 and simplify the result by omitting the products of equal vectors: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \,\mathbf{a}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{c}_{2}=\mathbf{a}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{2}\wedge2\mathbf{e}_{3}+\mathbf{a}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{2}\wedge5\mathbf{e}_{4}\\

The rank of a set

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\neq0$

 The rank of this set is 1 since these four vectors span a one-dimen\SpecialChar \-

\begin_layout Standard
We will now show how to use the exterior product for computing the rank

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to Theorem\InsetSpace ~
1 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Properties-of-the-ext-powers}

\end_inset

, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is linearly independent if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{n}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 So we first compute the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{n}$
\end_inset

.
 If this tensor is nonzero then the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is linearly independent, and the rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 If, on the other hand, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{n}=0$
\end_inset

, the rank is less than 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 We can determine the rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 by the following procedure.
 First, we assume that all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}\neq0$
\end_inset

 (any zero vectors can be omitted without changing the rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

).
 Then we compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

; if the result is zero, we may omit 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

 is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and try 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{3}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\neq0$
\end_inset

, we try 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{3}$
\end_inset

, and so on.
 The procedure can be formulated using induction in the obvious way.
 Eventually we will arrive at a subset 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{v}_{i_{1}},...,\mathbf{v}_{i_{k}}\}\subset S$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i_{1}}\wedge...\wedge...\mathbf{v}_{i_{k}}\neq0$
\end_inset

 but 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i_{1}}\wedge...\wedge...\mathbf{v}_{i_{k}}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{j}=0$
\end_inset

 for any other 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, there are no linearly independent subsets of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 having 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$
\end_inset

 or more vectors.
 Then the rank of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$

Statement: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose a set 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 of vectors has rank 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and contains 
\emph on
two
\emph default
 different linearly independent subsets, say 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{1}=\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{2}=\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{1},...,\mathbf{u}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

, both having 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 vectors (but no linearly independent subsets having 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$
\end_inset

 or more vectors).
 Then the tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{k}$
\end_inset

 are proportional to each other (as tensors from 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}V$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{k}$
\end_inset

 are both nonzero by Theorem\InsetSpace ~
1 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Properties-of-the-ext-powers}

\end_inset

.
 We will now show that it is possible to replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 by one of the vectors from the set 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{2}$
\end_inset

, say 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{l}$
\end_inset

, such that the new tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{l}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 is nonzero and proportional to the original tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 It will follow that this procedure can be repeated for every other vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

, until we replace all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

's by some 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

's and thus prove that the tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{k}$
\end_inset

 are proportional to each other.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to prove that the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 can be replaced.
 We need to find a suitable vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{l}$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{l}$
\end_inset

 be one of the vectors from 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{2}$
\end_inset

, and let us check whether 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 could be replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{l}$
\end_inset

.
 We first note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}\wedge\mathbf{u}_{l}=0$
\end_inset

 since there are no linearly independent subsets of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 having 
\begin_inset Formula $k+1$
\end_inset

 vectors.
 Hence the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{k},\mathbf{u}_{l}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly 
\emph on
dependent
\emph default
.
 It follows (since the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{i}\,|\, i=1,...,k\right\} $
\end_inset

 was linearly independent before we added 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{l}$
\end_inset

 to it) that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{l}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as a linear combination of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

's with some coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{i}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}_{l}=\alpha_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}+...+\alpha_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}.\]

\end_inset

If 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1}\neq0$
\end_inset

 then we will have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}_{l}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}=\alpha_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}.\]

\end_inset

The new tensor is nonzero and proportional to the old tensor, so we can
 replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{l}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
However, it could also happen that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1}=0$
\end_inset

.
 In that case we need to choose a different vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{l'}\in S_{2}$
\end_inset

 such that the corresponding coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1}$
\end_inset

 is nonzero.
 It remains to prove that such a choice is possible.
 If this were impossible then all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

's would have been expressible as linear combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

's with zero coefficients at the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 In that case, the exterior product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{k}$
\end_inset

 would be equal to a linear combination of exterior products of vectors
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $i=2,...,k$
\end_inset

.
 These exterior products contain 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 vectors among which only 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(k-1\right)$
\end_inset

 vectors are different.
 Such exterior products are all equal to zero.
 However, this contradicts the assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{k}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, at least one vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{l}$
\end_inset

 exists such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{1}\neq0$
\end_inset

, and the required replacement is always possible.

Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It follows from the above Statement that the subspace spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 can be uniquely characterized by a nonzero tensor such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 in which the constituents --- the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $\text{Span}\, S$

 It does not matter which linearly independent subset we choose for this
 purpose.
 We also have a computational procedure for determining the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Span}\, S$
\end_inset

 together with its dimension.
 Thus, we find that a

\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\wedge^{k}V$

\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 For a given subspace, this tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is unique up to a nonzero constant factor.
 Of course, the decomposition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 into an exterior product of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{i}\,|\, i=1,...,k\right\} $
\end_inset

 is not unique, but any such decomposition yields a set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{i}\,|\, i=1,...,k\right\} $

 spanning the same subspace.

 We will now rewrite Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Bijk formula}

\end_inset

) in a different form that will be more suitable for expressing exterior
 products of arbitrary tensors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us first consider the exterior product of three vectors as a map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{E}:V\otimes V\otimes V\rightarrow\wedge^{3}V$
\end_inset

.
 This map is linear and can be represented, in the index notation, in the
 following way:
\begin_inset Formula \[
u^{i}v^{j}w^{k}\mapsto\left(\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{w}\right)^{ijk}=\sum_{l,m,n}E_{lmn}^{ijk}u^{l}v^{m}w^{n},\]

\end_inset

where the array 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{lmn}^{ijk}$
\end_inset

 is the component representation of the map 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

.
 Comparing with the formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Bijk formula}

\end_inset

), we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{lmn}^{ijk}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed through the Kronecker 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

-symbol as
\begin_inset Formula \[
E_{lmn}^{ijk}=\delta_{l}^{i}\delta_{m}^{j}\delta_{n}^{k}-\delta_{l}^{i}\delta_{m}^{k}\delta_{n}^{j}+\delta_{l}^{k}\delta_{m}^{i}\delta_{n}^{j}-\delta_{l}^{k}\delta_{m}^{j}\delta_{n}^{i}+\delta_{l}^{j}\delta_{m}^{k}\delta_{n}^{i}-\delta_{l}^{j}\delta_{m}^{i}\delta_{n}^{k}.\]

\end_inset

 It is now clear that the exterior product of two vectors can be also written
 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v})^{ij}=\sum_{l,m}E_{lm}^{ij}u^{l}v^{m},\]

\end_inset

where
\begin_inset Formula \[
E_{lm}^{ij}=\delta_{l}^{i}\delta_{m}^{j}-\delta_{l}^{j}\delta_{m}^{i}.\]

\end_inset

By analogy, the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{E}:V\otimes...\otimes V\rightarrow\wedge^{n}V$
\end_inset

 (for 
\begin_inset Formula $2\leq n\leq N$
\end_inset

) can be represented in the index notation by the array of components 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{j_{1}...j_{n}}^{i_{1}...i_{n}}$
\end_inset

.
 This array is totally antisymmetric with respect to all the indices 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ i_{s}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and separately with respect to all 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ j_{s}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Using this array, the exterior product of two general antisymmetric tensors,
 say 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi\in\wedge^{m}V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\in\wedge^{n}V$
\end_inset

, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $m+n\leq N$
\end_inset

, can be represented in the index notation by
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\phi\wedge\psi)^{i_{1}...i_{m+n}}=\frac{1}{m!n!}\sum_{(j_{s},k_{s})}E_{j_{1}...j_{m}k_{1}...k_{n}}^{i_{1}...i_{m+n}}\phi^{j_{1}...j_{m}}\psi^{k_{1}...k_{n}}.\]

\end_inset

The combinatorial factor 
\begin_inset Formula $m!n!$
\end_inset

 is needed to compensate for the 
\begin_inset Formula $m!$
\end_inset

 equal terms arising from the summation over 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(j_{1},...,j_{m}\right)$
\end_inset

 due to the fact that 
\begin_inset Formula $\phi^{j_{1}...j_{m}}$
\end_inset

 is totally antisymmetric, and similarly for the 
\begin_inset Formula $n!$
\end_inset

 equal terms arising from the summation over 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(k_{1},...,k_{m}\right)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is useful to have a general formula for the array 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{j_{1}...j_{n}}^{i_{1}...i_{n}}$
\end_inset

 One way to define it is
\begin_inset Formula \[
E_{j_{1}...j_{n}}^{i_{1}...i_{n}}=\begin{cases}
\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma\right|} & \text{ if }\left(i_{1},...,i_{n}\right)\text{ is a permutation }\sigma\text{ of }\left(j_{1},...,j_{n}\right);\\
0 & \text{ otherwise}.\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

We will now show how one can express 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{j_{1}...j_{n}}^{i_{1}...i_{n}}$
\end_inset

 through the Levi-Civita symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The

\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

 according to the formula 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\varepsilon^{i_{1}...i_{N}}=\begin{cases}
\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma\right|} & \text{ if }\left(i_{1},...,i_{N}\right)\text{ is a permutation }\sigma\text{ of }\left(1,...,N\right);\\
0 & \text{otherwise.}\end{cases}\]

\end_inset

Comparing this with the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{j_{1}...j_{n}}^{i_{1}...i_{n}}$
\end_inset

, we notice that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\varepsilon^{i_{1}...i_{N}}=E_{1...N}^{i_{1}...i_{N}}.\]

\end_inset

Depending on convenience, we may write 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$

 with upper or lower indices since

 is just an array of numbers in this calculation.

 Since

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{1}V$

 It is easy to see that 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

-vectors and 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

-vectors either commute or anticommute, for instance
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

The general law of commutation and anticommutation can be written as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega_{k}\wedge\omega_{l}=\left(-1\right)^{kl}\omega_{l}\wedge\omega_{k},\]

neither

\emph on
nor

 is even.
 See Appendix\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times3$

 matrices.
 Since there are only two permutations of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,2\right)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(1,2\right)\mapsto\left(1,2\right)\;\text{and}\;\left(1,2\right)\mapsto\left(2,1\right),\]

\end_inset

we can write explicit formulas for these determinants: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\det\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a_{11} & a_{12}\\
a_{21} & a_{22}\end{array}\right) & =a_{11}a_{22}-a_{21}a_{12};\\

 & +a_{21}a_{32}a_{13}+a_{31}a_{12}a_{23}-a_{31}a_{22}a_{13}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

We note that the determinant of an 
\begin_inset Formula $N\times N$
\end_inset

 matrix has 
\begin_inset Formula $N!$
\end_inset

 terms in this type of formula, because there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N!$

 different permutations of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,...,N\right)$
\end_inset

.
 A numerical evaluation of the determinant of a large matrix using this
 formula is prohibitively long.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the definition D0 and the properties of permutations, one can directly
 prove various properties of determinants, for instance their antisymmetry
 with respect to exchanges of matrix rows or columns, and finally the relevance
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\det(A_{ij})$
\end_inset

 to linear equations 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j}A_{ij}x_{j}=a_{i}$
\end_inset

, as well as the important property 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\det\left(AB\right)=\left(\det A\right)\left(\det B\right).\]

\end_inset

Deriving these properties in this way will require long calculations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To me, definition D0 seems unmotivated and strange.
 It is not clear why this complicated combination of matrix elements has
 any useful properties at all.
 Even if so then maybe there exists another complicated combination of matrix
 elements that is even more useful? 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Yes, indeed: There exist other complicated combinations that are also useful.
 All this is best understood if we do not begin by studying the definition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:detA bad}

\end_inset

).
 Instead, we will proceed in a coordinate-free manner and build upon geometric
 intuition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will interpret the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{jk}$
\end_inset

 not as a

 but as a coordinate representation of a linear transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 in some vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 with respect to some given basis.
 We will define an action of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 on the exterior product space 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 in a certain way.
 That action will allow us to understand the properties and the uses of
 determinants without long calculations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another useful interpretation of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{jk}$
\end_inset

 is to regard it as a table of components of a 
\emph on
set
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}$

\end_inset

, that is,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{j}=\sum_{k=1}^{N}A_{jk}\mathbf{e}_{k},\quad j=1,...,N.\]

\end_inset

The determinant of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{jk}$
\end_inset

 is then naturally related to the exterior product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 This construction is especially useful for solving linear equations.

\begin_layout Standard
Of all the exterior power spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}V$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,2,...$
\end_inset

), the last nontrivial space is 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $N\equiv\dim V$
\end_inset

, for it is impossible to have a nonzero exterior product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N+1\right)$
\end_inset

 or more vectors.
 In other words, the spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N+1}V$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N+2}V$
\end_inset

 etc.\InsetSpace ~
are all zero-dimen\SpecialChar \-

\end_inset

, the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 is one-dimen\SpecialChar \-

 Therefore, all nonzero tensors from 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 are proportional to each other.
 Hence, any nonzero tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}\in\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 can serve as a basis tensor in 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
The space 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 is extremely useful because it is so simple and yet is directly related
 to determinants and volumes; this idea will be developed now.
 We begin by considering an example.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a two-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, let us choose a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and consider two arbitrary vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 These vectors can be decomposed in the basis as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{1}=a_{11}\mathbf{e}_{1}+a_{12}\mathbf{e}_{2},\;\mathbf{v}_{2}=a_{21}\mathbf{e}_{1}+a_{22}\mathbf{e}_{2},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ a_{ij}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are some coefficients.
 Let us now compute the 2-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\in\wedge^{2}V$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2} & =\left(a_{11}\mathbf{e}_{1}+a_{12}\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\wedge\left(a_{21}\mathbf{e}_{1}+a_{22}\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\\
 & =a_{11}a_{22}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}+a_{12}a_{21}\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}\\
 & =\left(a_{11}a_{22}-a_{12}a_{21}\right)\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

We may observe that firstly, the 2-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

 is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

, and secondly, the proportionality coefficient is equal to the determinant
 of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ij}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we compute the exterior product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{3}$
\end_inset

 of three vectors in a 3-dimen\SpecialChar \-

al space, we will similarly notice that
 the result is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}$
\end_inset

, and the proportionality coefficient is again equal to the determinant
 of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{ij}$

 The examples just given motivate us to study

tensors from the top exterior power space 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}=\lambda\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By Lemma\InsetSpace ~
1 from Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Properties-of-the-ext-powers}

\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 must be of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

, where the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent and thus a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Conversely, each basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 yields a nonzero tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\in\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

.
 This tensor has a useful geometric interpretation because, in some sense,
 it represents the

Proof of Statement:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
(1)
\series default
 To prove that the volumes are equal when the tensors are equal, we will
 transform the first basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{1},\mathbf{u}_{2},...,\mathbf{u}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 into the second basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{v}_{2},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 by a sequence of transformations of two types: either we will multiply
 one of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 by a number 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, or add 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 to another vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 We first need to demonstrate that any basis can be transformed into any
 other basis by this procedure.
 To demonstrate this, recall the proof of Theorem\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:All-bases-have}

\end_inset

 in which vectors from the first basis were systematically replaced by vectors
 of the second one.
 Each replacement can be implemented by a certain sequence of replacements
 of the kind 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{j}\rightarrow\lambda\mathbf{u}_{j}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{j}\rightarrow\mathbf{u}_{j}+\lambda\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{N}$
\end_inset

 changes in the same way as the volume under these replacements: The tensor
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{N}$
\end_inset

 gets multiplied by 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 after 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{j}\rightarrow\lambda\mathbf{u}_{j}$
\end_inset

 and remains unchanged after 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{j}\rightarrow\mathbf{u}_{j}+\lambda\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 At the end of the replacement procedure, the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 becomes the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 (up to the ordering of vectors), while the volume is multiplied by the
 same factor as the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 The ordering of the vectors in the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 can be changed with possibly a sign change in the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the statement\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:v1 eq v2}

\end_inset

) is equivalent to the assumption that the volumes of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are equal.

Let us now consider the interpretation of the above Statement.
 Suppose we somehow know that the parallelepiped spanned by the vectors
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{1},...,\mathbf{u}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 has unit volume.
 Given this knowledge, the volume of any other parallelepiped spanned by
 some other vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is easy to compute.
 Indeed, we can compute the tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{N}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 is one-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al, these two tensors must be proportional to each other.
 By expanding the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, it is straightforward to compute the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 in the relationship
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}=\lambda\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

The Statement now says that the volume of a parallelepiped spanned by the
 vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\lambda\right|$

 A tensor such as

 Indeed, a canonical isomorphism between 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When a scalar product is defined in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, there is a preferred choice of basis, namely an orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{e}_{i},\mathbf{e}_{j}\right\rangle =\delta_{ij}$
\end_inset

 (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Vector-spaces-with-scalar-product}

\end_inset

).
 Since the length of each of the basis vectors is 1, and the basis vectors
 are orthogonal to each other, the volume of the parallelepiped spanned
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

.
 (This is the usual Euclidean definition of volume.) Then the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{1}\equiv\bigwedge_{j=1}^{N}\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

 can be computed using this basis and used as a unit volume tensor.
 We will see below (Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{proof-of-pythagoras}

\end_inset

) that this tensor does not depend on the choice of the orthonormal basis,
 up to the orientation.
 The isomorphism between 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 is then fixed (up to the sign), thanks to the scalar product.

\begin_layout Standard
The idea that the volume is 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

oriented
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 can be understood perhaps more intuitively by considering the area of the
 parallelogram spanned by two vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 in the familiar 3-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al space.
 It is customary to draw the vector product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 as the representation of this area, since the length 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}\right|$
\end_inset

 is equal to the area, and the direction of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is normal to the area.
 Thus, the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 can be understood as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

oriented area
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of the parallelogram.
 However, note that the direction of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 depends not only on the angular orientation of the parallelogram in space,
 but also on the order of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 The 2-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is the natural analogue of the vector product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 in higher-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al spaces.
 Hence, it is algebraically natural to regard the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\in\wedge^{2}V$
\end_inset

 as the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

tensor-valued
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 representation of the area of the parallelogram spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider now a parallelogram spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 in a 
\emph on
two
\emph default
-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al plane.
 We can still represent the oriented area of this parallelogram by the vector
 product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

, where we imagine that the plane is embedded in a three-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al space.
 The area of the parallelogram does not have a nontrivial angular orientation
 any more since the vector product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is always orthogonal to the plane; the only feature left from the orientation
 is the positive or negative sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 relative to an arbitrarily chosen vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 normal to the plane.
 Hence, we may say that the sign of the oriented volume of a parallelepiped
 is the only remnant of the angular orientation of the parallelepiped in
 space when the dimension of the parallelepiped is equal to the dimension
 of space.

Let

 be a linear operator.
 Consider its action on tensors from the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 defined in the following way, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge...\mathbf{v}_{N}\mapsto\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 I denote this operation by 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\right)\equiv(\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1})\wedge...\wedge(\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N}).\]

\end_inset

The notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}$
\end_inset

 underscores the fact that there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 copies of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 acting simultaneously.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have just defined 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}$
\end_inset

 on single-term products 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

; the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}$
\end_inset

 on linear combinations of such products is obtained by requiring linearity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us verify that 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}$
\end_inset

 is a linear map; it is sufficient to check that it is compatible with the
 exterior product axioms:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{A}(\mathbf{v}+\lambda\mathbf{u})\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N} & =\hat{A}\mathbf{v}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N}\\
 & +\lambda\hat{A}\mathbf{u}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N}\;;\\
\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N} & =-\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N}\:.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}$
\end_inset

 is now defined as a linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V\rightarrow\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 is one-dimen\SpecialChar \-

 So 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}$
\end_inset

 multiplication by a number.

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}A^{N}=(\det\hat{A})\hat{1}_{\wedge^{N}V}$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement 1:

\begin_layout Standard
The determinant of a product is the product of determinants:

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Act with 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}$

 and then with 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{B}^{N}$
\end_inset

 on a nonzero tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

.
 Since these operators act as multiplication by a number, the result is
 the multiplication by the product of these numbers.
 We thus have
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N})(\wedge^{N}\hat{B}^{N})\omega=(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N})(\det\hat{B})\omega=(\det\hat{A})(\det\hat{B})\omega.\]

\end_inset

On the other hand, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N})(\wedge^{N}\hat{B}^{N})\omega & =(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N})\hat{B}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{B}\mathbf{v}_{N}\\
 & =\hat{A}\hat{B}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\hat{B}\mathbf{v}_{N}=\wedge^{N}(\hat{A}\hat{B})^{N}\omega\\
 & =(\det(\hat{A}\hat{B}))\omega.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\det(\hat{A}\hat{B})=(\det\hat{A})(\det\hat{B})$

If we consider the oriented (i.e.\InsetSpace ~

 Therefore we could define the determinant also in the following way:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Definition D2:

With this definition of the determinant, the property

\end_inset

 then the determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is given by the formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:detA bad}

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 defined by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:A op as tensor}

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{k}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}A_{jk}\mathbf{e}_{j}.\]

\end_inset

 A straightforward calculation is all that is needed to obtain the formula
 for the determinant.
 I first consider the case 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$
\end_inset

 as an illustration:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2}\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\right) & =\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{2}\\
 & =\left(A_{11}\mathbf{e}_{1}+A_{21}\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\wedge\left(A_{12}\mathbf{e}_{1}+A_{22}\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\\
 & =A_{11}A_{22}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}+A_{21}A_{12}\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{1}\\
 & =\left(A_{11}A_{22}-A_{12}A_{21}\right)\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}=A_{11}A_{22}-A_{12}A_{21}$
\end_inset

, in agreement with the usual formula.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now I consider the general case.
 The action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}$
\end_inset

 on the basis element 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}\in\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}\right) & =\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{N}\nonumber \\
=\left(\sum_{j_{1}=1}^{N}A_{j_{1}1}\mathbf{e}_{j_{1}}\right) & \wedge...\wedge\left(\sum_{j_{N}=1}^{N}A_{j_{N}N}\mathbf{e}_{j_{N}}\right)\nonumber \\
=\sum_{j_{1}=1}^{N}...\sum_{j_{N}=1}^{N} & A_{j_{1}1}\mathbf{e}_{j_{1}}\wedge...\wedge A_{j_{N}N}\mathbf{e}_{j_{N}}\nonumber \\
=\sum_{j_{1}=1}^{N}...\sum_{j_{N}=1}^{N} & (A_{j_{1}1}...A_{j_{N}N})\mathbf{e}_{j_{1}}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{j_{N}}.\label{eq:last permutation}\end{align}

\end_inset

In the last sum, the only nonzero terms are those in which the indices 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{N}$
\end_inset

 do not repeat; in other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(j_{1},...,j_{N}\right)$
\end_inset

 is a 
\emph on

\emph default
 of the set (1, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

).
 Let us therefore denote this permutation by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 and write 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(1)\equiv j_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(N)\equiv j_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 Using the antisymmetry of the exterior product and the definition of the
 parity 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|$
\end_inset

 of the permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

, we can express
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{e}_{j_{1}}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{j_{N}}=\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(1)}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{\sigma(N)}=\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma\right|}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

Question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have been working with operators more or less in the same way as with
 matrices, like in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:A op as tensor}

 What is the advantage of the coord\SpecialChar \-

 with the elements of matrices?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In some cases, there is no other way except to represent an operator in
 some basis through a matrix such as 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

.
 However, in many cases an interesting operator can be represented 
\emph on
geometrically
\emph default
, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
without choosing a basis.
 It is often useful to express an operator in a basis-free manner because
 this yields some nontrivial information that would otherwise be obscured
 by an unnecessary (or wrong) choice of basis.
 It is useful to be able to employ both the basis-free and the component-based
 techniques.
 Here are some examples where we compute determinants of operators defined
 without a basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example 1:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Operators of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{1}_{V}+\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}$
\end_inset

 are useful in geometry because they can represent reflections or projections
 with respect to an axis or a plane if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}$
\end_inset

 are chosen appropriately.
 For instance, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}\neq0$
\end_inset

, we can define a 
\series bold
hyperplane
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{hyperplane}

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{\mathbf{b}^{*}}\subset V$
\end_inset

 as the subspace annihilated by the covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
the subspace consisting of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)=0$
\end_inset

.
 If a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\in V$
\end_inset

 is such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}\left(\mathbf{a}\right)\neq0$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\not\in H_{\mathbf{b}^{*}}$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{P}\equiv\hat{1}_{V}-\frac{1}{\mathbf{b}^{*}\left(\mathbf{a}\right)}\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\]

\end_inset

is a projector
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{projector}

\end_inset

 onto 
\begin_inset Formula $H_{\mathbf{b}^{*}}$
\end_inset

, while the operator
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{R}\equiv\hat{1}_{V}-\frac{2}{\mathbf{b}^{*}\left(\mathbf{a}\right)}\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\]

\end_inset

describes a

The following statement shows how to calculate determinants of such operators.
 For instance, with the above definitions we would find 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{P}=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{R}=-1$
\end_inset

 by a direct application of Eq.\InsetSpace ~

Statement: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\in V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}\in V^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Then
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\det\left(\hat{1}_{V}+\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)=1+\mathbf{b}^{*}\left(\mathbf{a}\right).\label{eq:det lambda ab}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}=0$
\end_inset

, the formula is trivial, so we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Then we need to consider two cases: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}(\mathbf{a})\neq0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}(\mathbf{a})=0$
\end_inset

; however, the final formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:det lambda ab}

\end_inset

) is the same in both cases.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Case 1.
 By Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Dual-vector-space}

\end_inset

, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}\left(\mathbf{a}\right)\neq0$
\end_inset

 there exists a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a},\mathbf{v}_{2},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}_{i}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $2\leq i\leq N$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $N=\dim V$
\end_inset

.
 Then we compute the determinant by applying the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\left(\hat{1}_{V}+\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)^{N}$
\end_inset

 to the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

: since
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(\hat{1}_{V}+\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)\mathbf{a} & =\left(1+\mathbf{b}^{*}\left(\mathbf{a}\right)\right)\mathbf{a},\\
\left(\hat{1}_{V}+\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)\mathbf{v}_{i} & =\mathbf{v}_{i},\quad i=2,...,N,\end{align*}

\end_inset

we get
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\wedge^{N}\left(\hat{1}_{V}+\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)^{N}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\\
=\left(1+\mathbf{b}^{*}\left(\mathbf{a}\right)\right)\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\left(\hat{1}_{V}+\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)=1+\mathbf{b}^{*}\left(\mathbf{a}\right)$
\end_inset

, as required.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Case 2.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}\left(\mathbf{a}\right)=0$
\end_inset

, we will show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\left(\hat{1}_{V}+\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)=1$
\end_inset

.
 We cannot choose the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a},\mathbf{v}_{2},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 as in case 1, so we need to choose another basis.
 There exists some vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}\in V$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}\left(\mathbf{w}\right)\neq0$
\end_inset

 because by assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 It is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{w},\mathbf{a}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a linearly independent set: otherwise we would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}(\mathbf{w})=0$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, we can complete this set to a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{w},\mathbf{a},\mathbf{v}_{3},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Further, the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{3},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

 can be chosen such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}_{i}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $3\leq i\leq N$
\end_inset

.
 Now we compute the determinant by acting with the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\left(\hat{1}_{V}+\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)^{N}$
\end_inset

 on the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{w}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{3}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

: since
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(\hat{1}_{V}+\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)\mathbf{a} & =\mathbf{a},\\
\left(\hat{1}_{V}+\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)\mathbf{w} & =\mathbf{w}+\mathbf{b}^{*}\left(\mathbf{w}\right)\mathbf{a},\\
\left(\hat{1}_{V}+\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)\mathbf{v}_{i} & =\mathbf{v}_{i},\quad i=3,...,N,\end{align*}

\end_inset

we get
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\wedge^{N}\left(\hat{1}_{V}+\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)^{N}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{w}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{3}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\\
=\mathbf{a}\wedge\left(\mathbf{w}+\mathbf{b}^{*}\left(\mathbf{w}\right)\mathbf{a}\right)\wedge\mathbf{v}_{3}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\\
=\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{w}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{3}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\left(\hat{1}_{V}+\mathbf{a}\otimes\mathbf{b}^{*}\right)=1$

 A convenient basis tensor of the 3rd exterior power is

Note that the determinant formula\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:detA bad}

\end_inset

) applies to 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 square matrix, without referring to any transformations in any vector spaces.
 Sometimes it is useful to compute the determinants of matrices that do
 not represent linear transformations.
 Such matrices are really just 
\emph on
tables of numbers
\emph default
.
 The properties of determinants of course remain the same whether or not
 the matrix represents a linear transformation in the context of the problem
 we are solving.
 The geometric construction of the determinant through the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 is useful because it helps us understand heuristically where the properties
 of the determinant come from.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given just a square table of numbers, it is often useful to 
\emph on
introduce
\emph default
 a linear transformation corresponding to the matrix in some (conveniently
 chosen) basis; this often helps solve problems.
 An example frequently used in linear algebra is a matrix consisting of
 the components of some vectors in a basis.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\,|\, j=1,...,N\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\,|\, j=1,...,N\right\} $
\end_inset

 are some vectors.
 Since each of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 can be decomposed through the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, say 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}v_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{j},\quad i=1,...,N,\]

\end_inset

we may consider the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{ij}$
\end_inset

 as a square matrix.
 This matrix, at first glance, does not represent a linear transformation;
 it's just a square-shaped table of the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{ij}$
\end_inset

.
 However, let us 
\emph on
define
\emph default
 a linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 by the condition that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{i}=\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,N$
\end_inset

.
 This condition defines 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 for any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 if we assume the linearity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 (see Exercise\InsetSpace ~
2 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Examples-of-linear-maps}

\end_inset

).
 The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 has the following matrix representation with respect to the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and the dual basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{i}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{v}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{i}^{*}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{N}v_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{i}^{*}.\]

\end_inset

So the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{ji}$
\end_inset

 (the transpose of 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{ij}$
\end_inset

) is the matrix representing the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us consider the determinant of this transformation:
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\det\hat{A})\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}=\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{N}=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

The determinant of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{ji}$
\end_inset

 is thus equal to the determinant of the transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the computation of the determinant of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{ji}$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to the computation of the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\in\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 and its comparison with the basis tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 We have thus proved the following statement.

Corollary:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{ij}$
\end_inset

 as the table of coefficients of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, as explained above.
 Since
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\det v_{ji})\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N},\]

\end_inset

we need only to examine the properties of the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\equiv\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

 under various replacements.
 When a multiple of row 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is added to another row 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

, we replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}\mapsto\mathbf{v}_{j}+\lambda\mathbf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $j,k$
\end_inset

; then the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 does not change,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{j}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\left(\mathbf{v}_{j}+\lambda\mathbf{v}_{k}\right)\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N},\]

\end_inset

 hence the determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{ij}$
\end_inset

 does not change.
 To show that the determinant is linear as a function of each row, we consider
 the replacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}\mapsto\mathbf{u}+\lambda\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 for fixed 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

; the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is then equal to the sum of the tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, exchanging the rows 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

 in the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{ij}$
\end_inset

 corresponds to exchanging the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{l}$
\end_inset

, and then the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\det(A_{ji})\equiv\sum_{\sigma}\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma\right|}A_{1,\sigma(1)}...A_{N,\sigma(N)},\label{eq:det transpose 0}\end{equation}

\end_inset

so the only difference between 
\begin_inset Formula $\det(A_{ij})$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\det(A_{ji})$
\end_inset

 is the order of indices in the products of matrix elements, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{\sigma(i),i}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i,\sigma(i)}$
\end_inset

.
 We can show that the sum in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:det transpose 0}

\end_inset

) consists of exactly the same terms as the sum in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:detA bad}

 This is sufficient to prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det(A_{ij})=\det(A_{ji})$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The sum in Eq.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $A_{1,\sigma(1)}...A_{N,\sigma(N)}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is some permutation.
 We may reorder factors in this term,
\begin_inset Formula \[
A_{1,\sigma(1)}...A_{N,\sigma(N)}=A_{\sigma^{\prime}(1),1}...A_{\sigma^{\prime}(N),N},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma'$

\begin_inset Formula $A_{i,\sigma(i)}=A_{\sigma^{\prime}(i),i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,N$
\end_inset

.
 This is achieved when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma'$
\end_inset

 is the permutation inverse to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
we need to use 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{\prime}\equiv\sigma^{-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Since there exists precisely one inverse permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{-1}$
\end_inset

 for each permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

, we may transform the sum in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:det transpose 0}

\end_inset

) into a sum over all inverse permutations 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma'$
\end_inset

; each permutation will still enter exactly once into the new sum.
 Since the parity of the inverse permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is the same as the parity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 (see Statement\InsetSpace ~
3 in Appendix\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Properties-of-permutations}

), the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-1\right)^{|\sigma|}$

 will remain unchanged.
 Therefore, the sum will remain the same.

 We have

\end_inset

Now we would like to relate this expression with the analogous expression
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{T}$
\end_inset

 In order to use the definition of

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{i}$

 Therefore, we act with the

\end_inset

 (this canonical action was defined by Definition\InsetSpace ~
3 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

 Since this action is linear, we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega^{*}(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}\omega)=(\det\hat{A})\omega^{*}(\omega).\]

\end_inset

(Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega^{*}(\omega)\neq0$
\end_inset

 since by assumption the tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

\begin_inset Formula $\omega^{*}$
\end_inset

 are nonzero.) On the other hand, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\omega^{*}\big({\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}}\omega\big) & =\sum_{\sigma}(-1)^{\left|\sigma\right|}\mathbf{f}_{1}^{*}(\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{\sigma(1)})...\mathbf{f}_{N}^{*}(\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{\sigma(N)})\\

Solution:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider one of the coefficients, for example 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{11}\equiv\mathbf{f}_{1}^{*}(\mathbf{e}_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 This coefficient can be determined from the tensor equality
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}=B_{11}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}.\label{eq:laplace}\end{equation}

\end_inset

We could reduce 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{11}$
\end_inset

 to a determinant of an 
\begin_inset Formula $(N-1)\times(N-1)$
\end_inset

 matrix if we could cancel 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 on both sides of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:laplace}

\end_inset

).
 We would be able to cancel 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 if we had a tensor equality of the form 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\psi=B_{11}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N},\]

\end_inset

 where the (
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

)-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 were proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

 in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:laplace}

\end_inset

) is not necessarily proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

; so we need to transform Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:laplace}

\end_inset

) to a suitable form.
 In order to do this, we transform the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 into vectors that belong to the subspace spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{2},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 We subtract from each 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $i=2,...,N$
\end_inset

) a suitable multiple of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and define the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{i}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $i=2,...,N$
\end_inset

) such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}(\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{i})=0$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{i}\equiv\mathbf{v}_{i}-\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}(\mathbf{v}_{i})\mathbf{e}_{1},\quad i=2,...,N.\]

\end_inset

Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{i}\in\text{Span}\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{2},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and also 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}=\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

 Now Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:laplace}

\end_inset

) is rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{N}=B_{11}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{i}\in\text{Span}\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{2},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

, the tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{N}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

 are proportional to each other.
 Now we are allowed to cancel 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and obtain 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{N}=B_{11}\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

Note that the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{i}$
\end_inset

 have the first components equal to zero.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{11}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the determinant of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{ij}$
\end_inset

 from which row 1 (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

) and column 1 (the coefficients at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

) have been deleted.
 The coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{1j}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $j=2,...,N$
\end_inset

 are calculated similarly.

\begin_layout Standard
Let us see how determinants are written in the index notation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to use the index notation, we need to fix a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and represent each vector and each tensor by their components in that basis.
 Determinants are related to the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

.
 Let us consider a set of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}\}$
\end_inset

 and the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi\equiv\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\in\wedge^{N}V.\]

\end_inset

Since the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 is one-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al and its basis consists of the single tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

, the index representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 consists, in principle, of the single number 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 in a formula such as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi=C\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

 However, it is more convenient to use a totally antisymmetric array of
 numbers having 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 indices, 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{i_{1}...i_{N}}$
\end_inset

, so that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi=\frac{1}{N!}\sum_{i_{1},...,i_{N}=1}^{N}\psi^{i_{1}...i_{N}}\mathbf{e}_{i_{1}}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{i_{N}}.\]

\end_inset

Then the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $C\equiv\psi^{12...N}$
\end_inset

.
 In the formula above, the combinatorial factor 
\begin_inset Formula $N!$
\end_inset

 compensates the fact that we are summing an antisymmetric product of vectors
 with a totally antisymmetric array of coefficients.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To write such arrays more conveniently, one can use Levi-Civita symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{i_{1}...i_{N}}$
\end_inset

 (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Exterior-product-in-index}

\end_inset

).
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Levi-Civita symbol}

\end_inset

 It is clear that any other totally antisymmetric array of numbers with
 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 indices, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{i_{1}...i_{N}}$
\end_inset

, is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{i_{1}...i_{N}}$
\end_inset

: For indices 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ i_{1},...,i_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 that correspond to a permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi^{i_{1}...i_{N}}=\psi^{12...N}(-1)^{\left|\sigma\right|},\]

\end_inset

and hence
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi^{i_{1}...i_{N}}=(\psi^{12...N})\varepsilon^{i_{1}...i_{N}}.\]

How to compute the index representation of

 given the array 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}^{k}$
\end_inset

 of the components of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

? We need to represent the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi\equiv\sum_{\sigma}\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma\right|}\mathbf{v}_{\sigma(1)}\otimes\mathbf{v}_{\sigma(2)}\otimes...\otimes\mathbf{v}_{\sigma(N)}.\]

\end_inset

Hence, we can use the Levi-Civita symbol and write
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\psi^{12...N} & =\sum_{\sigma}\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma\right|}v_{\sigma(1)}^{1}\otimes v_{\sigma(2)}^{2}\otimes...\otimes v_{\sigma(N)}^{N}\\
 & =\sum_{i_{1},...,i_{N}=1}^{N}\varepsilon^{i_{1}...i_{N}}v_{i_{1}}^{1}...v_{i_{N}}^{N}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The component 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{12...N}$
\end_inset

 is the only number we need to represent 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Levi-Civita symbol itself can be seen as the index representation of

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 (The components of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 in a different basis will, of course, differ from 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{i_{1}...i_{N}}$
\end_inset

 by a constant factor.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now let us construct the index representation of the determinant of an operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 The operator is given by its matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{j}^{i}$
\end_inset

 and acts on a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 with components 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{i}$
\end_inset

 yielding a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\equiv\hat{A}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 with components
\begin_inset Formula \[
u^{k}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}A_{i}^{k}v^{i}.\]

\end_inset

Hence, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}$
\end_inset

 acting on 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 yields an antisymmetric tensor whose component with the indices 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}...k_{N}$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left[(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N})\psi\right]^{k_{1}...k_{N}} & =\left[\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N}\right]^{k_{1}...k_{N}}\\
 & =\sum_{i_{s},j_{s}}\varepsilon^{i_{1}...i_{N}}A_{j_{1}}^{k_{1}}v_{i_{1}}^{j_{1}}...A_{j_{N}}^{k_{N}}v_{i_{N}}^{j_{N}}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}\psi$
\end_inset

 is proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 with the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, the same proportionality holds for the components of these tensors:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\sum_{i_{s},j_{s}}\varepsilon^{i_{1}...i_{N}}A_{j_{1}}^{k_{1}}v_{i_{1}}^{j_{1}}...A_{j_{N}}^{k_{N}}v_{i_{N}}^{j_{N}} & =(\det\hat{A})\psi^{k_{1}...k_{N}}\\
 & =(\det\hat{A})\sum_{i_{s}}\varepsilon^{i_{1}...i_{N}}v_{i_{1}}^{k_{1}}...v_{i_{N}}^{k_{N}}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The relation above must hold for arbitrary vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 This is sufficient to derive a formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are arbitrary, we may select 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 as the basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{i}^{k}=\delta_{i}^{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Substituting this into the equation above, we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{i_{s},j_{s}}\varepsilon^{i_{1}...i_{N}}A_{i_{1}}^{k_{1}}...A_{i_{N}}^{k_{N}}=(\det\hat{A})\varepsilon^{k_{1}...k_{N}}.\]

\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

The left side of the relation above is obviously antisymmetric in the free
 indices 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 times the Levi-Civita symbol.
 This relation is the same as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}\omega=C\omega,\]

\end_inset

but written in the index notation.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 multiplying with another Levi-Civita symbol 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{k_{1}...k_{N}}$
\end_inset

, written this time with lower indices to comply with the summation convention,
 and summing over all 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{s}$
\end_inset

 By elementary combinatorics (there are 
\begin_inset Formula $N!$
\end_inset

 possibilities to choose the indices 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}$

\begin_inset Formula $k_{N}$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k_{1},...,k_{N}}\varepsilon_{k_{1}...k_{N}}\varepsilon^{k_{1}...k_{N}}=N!,\]

\end_inset

and therefore
\begin_inset Formula \[
\det(\hat{A})=\frac{1}{N!}\sum_{i_{s},k_{s}}\varepsilon_{k_{1}...k_{N}}\varepsilon^{i_{1}...i_{N}}A_{i_{1}}^{k_{1}}...A_{i_{N}}^{k_{N}}.\]

\end_inset

This formula can be seen as the index representation of 
\begin_inset Formula \[

A system of

\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$

 can be written in the matrix form,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{j=1}^{N}A_{ij}x_{j}=b_{i},\quad i=1,...,N.\label{eq:linear system}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is a given matrix of coefficients, and the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $b_{i}$
\end_inset

 are also given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first step in studying Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:linear system}

\end_inset

) is to interpret it in a geometric way, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is not merely a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

table of numbers
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 but a geometric object.
 We introduce an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $V=\mathbb{R}^{N}$
\end_inset

, in which a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is fixed.
 There are two options (both will turn out to be useful).
 The first option is to interpret 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{j}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 as the coefficients representing some linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 and some vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b},\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}\equiv\sum_{i,j=1}^{N}A_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*},\quad\mathbf{b}\equiv\sum_{j=1}^{N}b_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j},\quad\mathbf{x}\equiv\sum_{j=1}^{N}x_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}.\]

\end_inset

Then we reformulate Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:linear system}

\end_inset

) as the vector equation
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\hat{A}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b},\label{eq:Ax equals a}\end{equation}

\end_inset

from which we would like to find the unknown vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second option is to interpret 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

 as the components of a 
\emph on
set
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{1},...,\mathbf{a}_{N}\right\} $

 with respect to the basis, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}_{j}\equiv\sum_{i=1}^{N}A_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{i},\quad j=1,...,N,\]

\end_inset

to define 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 as before,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{b}\equiv\sum_{j=1}^{N}b_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j},\]

\end_inset

and to rewrite Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:linear system}

\end_inset

) as an equation expressing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 as a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 with unknown coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{j=1}^{N}x_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}=\mathbf{b}.\label{eq:x a equals b}\end{equation}

\end_inset

In this interpretation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is just a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 unknown numbers.
 These numbers could be interpreted the set of components of the vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 were actually a basis, which is not necessarily the case.

Let us begin with the first interpretation, Eq.\InsetSpace ~

 When does Eq.\InsetSpace ~

\end_inset

; then the solution is found as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\hat{A}^{-1}\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 The condition for the existence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is that the determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is nonzero.
 When the determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is zero, the solution may or may not exist, and the solution is more complicate

 I will give a proof of these statements based on the new definition D1
 of the determinant.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Theorem 1: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}\neq0$
\end_inset

, the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 has a unique solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}\in V$
\end_inset

.
 There exists a linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 such that the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\hat{A}^{-1}\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{i}\,|\, i=1,...,N\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 It follows from 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}\neq0$
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}\right)=(\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{1})\wedge...\wedge(\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{N})\neq0.\]

\end_inset

By Theorem\InsetSpace ~
1 of Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Properties-of-the-ext-powers}

\end_inset

, the set of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{1},...,\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{N}\}$
\end_inset

 is linearly independent and therefore is a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Thus there exists a unique set of coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ c_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{b}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}c_{i}(\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{i}).\]

\end_inset

Then due to linearity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 we have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{b}=\hat{A}\sum_{i=1}^{N}c_{i}\mathbf{e}_{i};\]

\end_inset

in other words, the solution of the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\equiv\sum_{i=1}^{N}c_{i}\mathbf{e}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ c_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are determined uniquely, the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is unique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 as follows.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 is a basis, there exists the corresponding dual basis, which we may denote
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Then the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}=\mathbf{v}_{i}^{*}(\mathbf{b})$
\end_inset

, and the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{x}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}c_{i}\mathbf{e}_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{e}_{i}\mathbf{v}_{i}^{*}(\mathbf{b})=\big(\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{v}_{i}^{*}\big)\mathbf{b}\equiv\hat{A}^{-1}\mathbf{b}.\]

\end_inset

This shows explicitly that the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 exists and is linear.

 This set must be linearly dependent since

\begin_layout Standard
Once the inverse operator

 However, if we only need to solve

\begin_layout Standard
We will now use the second interpretation, Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:x a equals b}

\end_inset

), of a linear system.
 This equation claims that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination of the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 vectors of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{1},...,\mathbf{a}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, this is true for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{1},...,\mathbf{a}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

; in that case, the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 exists and is unique because the dual basis, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{j}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

, exists and allows us to write the solution as
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{j}=\mathbf{a}_{j}^{*}(\mathbf{b}).\]

\end_inset

 On the other hand, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{1},...,\mathbf{a}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is not a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 it is not certain that some given vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 In that case, the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 may or may not exist, and when it exists it will not be unique.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We first consider the case where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ x_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 exists, and we would like to determine it more explicitly.
 We recall that an explicit computation of the dual basis was shown in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Computing-the-dual}

\end_inset

.
 Motivated by the constructions given in that section, we consider the tensor
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega\equiv\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{N}\in\wedge^{N}V\]

\end_inset

and additionally the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \omega_{j}\,|\, j=1,...,N\right\} $
\end_inset

, defined by
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\omega_{j}\equiv\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{j-1}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{a}_{j+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{N}\in\wedge^{N}V.\label{eq:omega j def}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{j}$
\end_inset

 is the exterior product of all the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{N}$
\end_inset

 except that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{j}$
\end_inset

 is replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 Since we know that the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 exists, we can substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}\mathbf{a}_{i}$
\end_inset

 into Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:omega j def}

\end_inset

) and find
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega_{j}=\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge x_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{N}=x_{j}\omega.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis, the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 is nonzero (Theorem\InsetSpace ~
1 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Properties-of-the-ext-powers}

\end_inset

).
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,N$
\end_inset

) can be computed as the coefficient of proportionality between 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{j}=\frac{\omega_{j}}{\omega}=\frac{\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{j-1}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{a}_{j+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{N}}{\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{N}}.\]

 We have seen in Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Rank-of-a-set-of-vectors}

\end_inset

 that there exists a maximal nonzero exterior product of some linearly independe

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{j}$
\end_inset

's.
 Let us now denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 this maximal exterior product.
 Without loss of generality, we may renumber the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{j}$
\end_inset

's so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{r}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is the rank of the set

\end_inset

 If the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}=\mathbf{b}$

 has a solution then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$

\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\mathbf{b}=0$

.
 We can check whether 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\mathbf{b}=0$
\end_inset

 since we have already computed 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 If we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\mathbf{b}\neq0$

 belongs to the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Span}\,\{\mathbf{a}_{1},...,\mathbf{a}_{r}\}$

\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}=\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 
\emph on

 To determine all solutions, we will note that the set

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is uniquely represented as a linear combination of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1},...,\mathbf{a}_{r}$
\end_inset

 In other words, there is a unique solution of the form
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

that may have nonzero coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}^{(1)},...,x_{r}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 only up to the component number 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

, after which 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}^{(1)}=0$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $r+1\leq i\leq n$
\end_inset

).
 To obtain the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

, we use Kramer's rule for the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Span}\,\{\mathbf{a}_{1},...,\mathbf{a}_{r}\}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{i}^{(1)}=\frac{\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{j-1}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{a}_{j+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{r}}{\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{r}}.\]

\end_inset

We can now obtain the general solution of the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}=\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 by adding to the solution 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 an arbitrary solution 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{i}^{(0)}$
\end_inset

 of the homogeneous equation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_{j}^{(0)}\mathbf{a}_{j}=0$
\end_inset

.
 The solutions of the homogeneous equation build a subspace that can be
 determined as an eigenspace of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 as considered in the previous subsection.
 We can also determine the homogeneous solutions using the method of this
 section, as follows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We decompose the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{r+1},...,\mathbf{a}_{n}$
\end_inset

 into linear combinations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{r}$
\end_inset

 again by using Kramer's rule:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{a}_{k} & =\sum_{j=1}^{r}\alpha_{kj}\mathbf{a}_{j},\quad k=r+1,...,n,\\
\alpha_{kj} & \equiv\frac{\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{j-1}\wedge\mathbf{a}_{k}\wedge\mathbf{a}_{j+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{r}}{\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{r}}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Having computed the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{kj}$
\end_inset

, we determine the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(n-r\right)$
\end_inset

-dimen\SpecialChar \-

al space of homogeneous solutions.
 This space is spanned by the 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(n-r\right)$
\end_inset

 solutions that can be chosen, for example, as follows:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
x_{i}^{(0)(r+1)} & =(\alpha_{(r+1)1},...,\alpha_{(r+1)r},-1,0,...,0),\\
x_{i}^{(0)(r+2)} & =(\alpha_{(r+2)1},...,\alpha_{(r+2)r},0,-1,...,0),\\
 & ...\\
x_{i}^{(0)(n)} & =(\alpha_{n1},...,\alpha_{nr},0,0,...,-1).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Finally, the solution of the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}=\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 can be written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{i}=x_{i}^{(1)}+\sum_{k=r+1}^{n}\beta_{k}x_{i}^{(0)(k)},\quad i=1,...,n,\]

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the linear system
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
2x+y & =1\\
2x+2y+z & =4\\
y+z & =3\end{align*}

\end_inset

Let us apply the procedure above to this system.
 We interpret this system as the vector equation 
\begin_inset Formula $x\mathbf{a}+y\mathbf{b}+z\mathbf{c}=\mathbf{p}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}=\left(2,2,0\right)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}=\left(1,2,1\right)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}=\left(0,1,1\right)$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{p}=\left(1,4,3\right)$
\end_inset

 are given vectors.
 Introducing an explicit basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{3}\right\} $
\end_inset

, we compute (using elimination) 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b} & =\left(2\mathbf{e}_{1}+2\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\wedge\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}+2\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{3}\right)\\
 & =2\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}+\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\wedge\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}+2\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{3}\right)\\
 & =2\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}+\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\wedge\left(\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{3}\right)=\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{c}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}=0$
\end_inset

, and the maximal nonzero exterior product can be chosen as 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\equiv\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 Now we check whether the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{p}$
\end_inset

 belongs to the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Span}\,\left\{ \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right\} $
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\omega\wedge\mathbf{p} & =2\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}+\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\wedge\left(\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{3}\right)\wedge\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}+4\mathbf{e}_{2}+3\mathbf{e}_{3}\right)\\
 & =2\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}+\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\wedge\left(\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{3}\right)\wedge3(\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{3})=0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{p}$
\end_inset

 can be represented as a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 To determine the coefficients, we use Kramer's rule: 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{p}=\alpha\mathbf{a}+\beta\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 where
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\alpha & =\frac{\mathbf{p}\wedge\mathbf{b}}{\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}}=\frac{\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}+4\mathbf{e}_{2}+3\mathbf{e}_{3}\right)\wedge\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}+2\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{3}\right)}{2\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}+\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\wedge\left(\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{3}\right)}\\
 & =\frac{-2\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}-2\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}-2\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}}{2\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}+\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}\right)}=-1;\\
\beta & =\frac{\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{p}}{\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}}=\frac{2\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}+\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\wedge\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}+4\mathbf{e}_{2}+3\mathbf{e}_{3}\right)}{2\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}+\mathbf{e}_{2}\right)\wedge\left(\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{3}\right)}\\
 & =\frac{3\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}+3\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}+3\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}}{\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}+\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}}=3.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{p}=-\mathbf{a}+3\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

; thus the inhomogeneous solution is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}^{(1)}=\left(-1,3,0\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To determine the space of homogeneous solutions, we decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 into a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 by the same method; the result is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}=-\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{a}+\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

.
 So the space of homogeneous solutions is spanned by the single solution
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{i}^{(0)(1)}=\left(-{\textstyle \frac{1}{2}},1,-1\right).\]

\end_inset

Finally, we write the general solution as
\begin_inset Formula \[
x_{i}=x_{i}^{(1)}+\beta x_{i}^{(0)(1)}=\left(-1-{\textstyle \frac{1}{2}}\beta,3+\beta,-\beta\right),\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 is an arbitrary constant.

Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the calculations of the coefficients according to Kramer's rule the numerator
s and the denominators always contain the same tensor, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}+\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}$
\end_inset

, multiplied by a constant factor.
 We have seen this in the above examples.
 This is guaranteed to happen in every case; it is impossible that a numerator
 should contain 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}+2\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}$

 or some other tensor not proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 Therefore, in practical calculations it is sufficient to compute just one

 Let us first compute the determinant for a Vandermonde matrix of small

 & =\prod_{1\leq i<j\leq N}(x_{j}-x_{i}).\label{eq:Vandermonde formula 1}\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us represent the Vandermonde matrix as a table of the components of
 a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 with respect to some basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Looking at the Vandermonde matrix, we find that the components of the vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,1,...,1\right)$
\end_inset

, so
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{1}=\mathbf{e}_{1}+...+\mathbf{e}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

The components of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{N}\right)$
\end_inset

; the components of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{3}$
\end_inset

 are 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x_{1}^{2},x_{2}^{2},...,x_{N}^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Generally, the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,N$
\end_inset

) has components 
\begin_inset Formula $(x_{1}^{j-1},...,x_{N}^{j-1})$
\end_inset

.
 It is convenient to introduce a linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{1}=x_{1}\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{N}=x_{N}\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

; in other words, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is diagonal in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

 is an eigenvector of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 with the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 A tensor representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}x_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}.\]

\end_inset

Then we have a short formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{j}=\hat{A}^{j-1}\mathbf{u},\quad j=1,...,N;\quad\mathbf{u}\equiv\mathbf{v}_{1}=\mathbf{e}_{1}+...+\mathbf{e}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

According to Statement 1 of Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Determinants-of-square}

\end_inset

, the determinant of the Vandermonde matrix is equal to the coefficient
 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

 in the equation
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}=C\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

So our purpose now is to determine 
\begin_inset Formula $C$
\end_inset

.
 Let us use the formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 to rewrite
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}=\mathbf{u}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{u}\wedge\hat{A}^{2}\mathbf{u}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}^{N-1}\mathbf{u}.\label{eq:product 3}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Now we use the following trick: since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{a}\wedge\left(\mathbf{b}+\lambda\mathbf{a}\right)$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

, we may replace 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{u}\wedge(\hat{A}\mathbf{u}+\lambda\mathbf{u})=\mathbf{u}\wedge(\hat{A}+\lambda\hat{1})\mathbf{u}.\]

\end_inset

Similarly, we may replace the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{2}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $(\hat{A}^{2}+\lambda_{1}\hat{A}+\lambda_{2})\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, with arbitrary coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 We may pull this trick in every factor in the tensor product\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:product 3}

\end_inset

) starting from the second factor.
 In effect, we may replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 by an arbitrary polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{k}(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 as long as the coefficient at 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 remains 1.
 (Such polynomials are called 
\series bold
monic
\series default
 
\series bold
polynomials
\series default
.)
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{monic polynomial}

\end_inset

 So we obtain
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \mathbf{u}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{u}\wedge\hat{A}^{2}\mathbf{u}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}^{N-1}\mathbf{u}\\
 & =\mathbf{u}\wedge p_{1}(\hat{A})\mathbf{u}\wedge p_{2}(\hat{A})\hat{A}\mathbf{u}\wedge...\wedge p_{N-1}(\hat{A})\mathbf{u}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since we may choose the monic polynomials 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 arbitrarily, we would like to choose them such that the formula is simplified
 as much as possible.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us first choose the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{N-1}$
\end_inset

 because that polynomial has the highest degree (
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

) and so affords us the most freedom.
 Here comes another trick: If we choose 
\begin_inset Formula \[
p_{N-1}(x)\equiv\left(x-x_{1}\right)\left(x-x_{2}\right)...\left(x-x_{N-1}\right),\]

\end_inset

then the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{N-1}(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 will be much simplified: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
p_{N-1}(\hat{A})\mathbf{e}_{N}=p_{N-1}(x_{N})\mathbf{e}_{N};\; p_{N-1}(\hat{A})\mathbf{e}_{j}=0,\quad j=1,...,N-1.\]

\end_inset

Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{N-1}(\hat{A})\mathbf{u}=p_{N-1}(x_{N})\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 Now we repeat this trick for the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{N-2}$
\end_inset

, choosing
\begin_inset Formula \[
p_{N-2}(x)\equiv\left(x-x_{1}\right)...\left(x-x_{N-2}\right)\]

\end_inset

and finding 
\begin_inset Formula \[
p_{N-2}(\hat{A})\mathbf{u}=p_{N-2}(x_{N-1})\mathbf{e}_{N-1}+p_{N-2}(x_{N})\mathbf{e}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

We need to compute the exterior product, which simplifies: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & p_{N-2}(\hat{A})\mathbf{u}\wedge p_{N-1}(\hat{A})\mathbf{u}\\
 & =\left(p_{N-2}(x_{N-1})\mathbf{e}_{N-1}+p_{N-2}(x_{N})\mathbf{e}_{N}\right)\wedge p_{N-1}(x_{N})\mathbf{e}_{N}\\
 & =p_{N-2}(x_{N-1})\mathbf{e}_{N-1}\wedge p_{N-1}(x_{N})\mathbf{e}_{N}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Proceeding inductively in this fashion, we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \mathbf{u}\wedge p_{1}(\hat{A})\mathbf{u}\wedge...\wedge p_{N-1}(\hat{A})\mathbf{u}\\
 & =\mathbf{u}\wedge p_{1}(x_{2})\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge...\wedge p_{N-1}(x_{N})\mathbf{e}_{N}\\
 & =p_{1}(x_{2})...p_{N-1}(x_{N})\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N},\end{align*}

\end_inset

where we defined each monic polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}(x)$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
p_{j}(x)\equiv(x-x_{1})...(x-x_{j}),\quad j=1,...,N-1.\]

\end_inset

For instance, 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}(x)=x-x_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The product of the polynomials, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & p_{1}(x_{2})p_{2}(x_{3})...p_{N-1}(x_{N})\\
 & =\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)(x_{3}-x_{1})(x_{3}-x_{2})...(x_{N}-x_{N-1})\\
 & =\prod_{1\leq i<j\leq N}\left(x_{j}-x_{i}\right).\end{align*}

\end_inset

yields the required formula\InsetSpace ~

This somewhat long argument explains the procedure of subtracting various

 Then the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent.
 (The number 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 of the vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

; the statement holds also for infinite-dimen\SpecialChar \-

al spaces).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us show that the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\,|\, j=1,...,n\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent.
 By definition of linear independence, we need to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}=0$
\end_inset

 is possible only if all the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}$
\end_inset

 are equal to zero.
 Let us denote 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}c_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

 and assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Consider the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{n-1}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

; by assumption all these vectors are equal to zero.
 The condition that these vectors are equal to zero is a system of vector
 equations that looks like this,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
c_{1}\mathbf{e}_{1}+...+c_{n}\mathbf{e}_{n} & =0,\\
c_{1}\lambda_{1}\mathbf{e}_{1}+...+c_{n}\lambda_{n}\mathbf{e}_{n} & =0,\\
...\\
c_{1}\lambda_{1}^{n-1}\mathbf{e}_{1}+...+c_{n}\lambda_{n}^{n-1}\mathbf{e}_{n} & =0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

This system of equations can be written in a matrix form with the Vandermonde
 matrix,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 1 & \cdots & 1\\
\lambda_{1} & \lambda_{2} &  & \lambda_{n}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots\\
\lambda_{1}^{n-1} & \lambda_{2}^{n-1} & \cdots & \lambda_{n}^{n-1}\end{array}\right)\left[\begin{array}{c}
c_{1}\mathbf{e}_{1}\\
c_{2}\mathbf{e}_{2}\\
\vdots\\
c_{n}\mathbf{e}_{n}\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
0\\
0\\
\vdots\\
0\end{array}\right].\]

\end_inset

Since the eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{j}$
\end_inset

 are (by assumption) all different, the determinant of the Vandermonde matrix
 is nonzero.
 Therefore, this system of equations has only the trivial solution, 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}\neq0$
\end_inset

, it is necessary that all 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{j}=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...n$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
If the numbers

\end_inset

 are all different and numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{1}$

 are arbitrary then there exists a unique polynomial

 that has values 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{j}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,N$
\end_inset

).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us try to determine the coefficients of the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)$
\end_inset

.
 We write a polynomial with unknown coefficients, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
p(x)=p_{0}+p_{1}x+...+p_{N-1}x^{N-1},\]

\end_inset

and obtain a system of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 linear equations, 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x_{j})=y_{j}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,N$
\end_inset

), for the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 unknowns 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 The crucial observation is that this system of equations has the Vandermonde
 matrix.
 For example, with 
\begin_inset Formula $N=3$
\end_inset

 we have three equations,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
p(x_{1})=p_{0}+p_{1}x_{1}+p_{2}x_{1}^{2} & =y_{1},\\
p(x_{2})=p_{0}+p_{1}x_{2}+p_{2}x_{2}^{2} & =y_{2},\\
p(x_{3})=p_{0}+p_{1}x_{3}+p_{2}x_{3}^{2} & =y_{3},\end{align*}

\end_inset

which can be rewritten in the matrix form as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & x_{1} & x_{1}^{2}\\
1 & x_{2} & x_{2}^{2}\\
1 & x_{3} & x_{3}^{2}\end{array}\right)\left[\begin{array}{c}
p_{0}\\
p_{1}\\
p_{2}\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
y_{1}\\
y_{2}\\
y_{3}\end{array}\right].\]

\end_inset

Since the determinant of the Vandermonde matrix is nonzero as long as all
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 are different, these equations always have a unique solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ p_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the required polynomial always exists and is unique.

As we have seen, the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 on the exterior power 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\mapsto\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N}\]

\end_inset

has been very useful.
 However, this is not the only way 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 can act on an 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-vector.
 Let us explore other possibilities; we will later see that they have their
 uses as well.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A straightforward generalization is to promote an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\in\textrm{End }V$
\end_inset

 to a linear operator in the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}V$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $k<N$
\end_inset

 (rather than in the top exterior power 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

).
 We denote this by 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\wedge^{k}\hat{A}^{k})\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}=\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{k}.\]

\end_inset

This is, of course, a linear map of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 to itself (but not any more a mere multiplication by a scalar!).
 For instance, in 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{2}V$
\end_inset

 we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2})\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}=\hat{A}\mathbf{u}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}.\]

\end_inset

However, this is not the only possibility.
 We could, for instance, define another map of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{2}V$
\end_inset

 to itself like this, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\mapsto(\hat{A}\mathbf{u})\wedge\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}\wedge(\hat{A}\mathbf{v}).\]

\end_inset

This map is 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 (as well as being a linear map of

 to itself), so I denote this map by 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1}$
\end_inset

 to emphasize that it contains 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 only linearly.
 I call such maps

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It turns out that operators of this kind play an important role in many
 results related to determinants.
 Let us now generalize the examples given above.
 We denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 a linear map 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}V\rightarrow\wedge^{m}V$
\end_inset

 that acts on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{m}$
\end_inset

 by producing a sum of terms with 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 copies of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 in each term.
 For instance,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1}\left(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\right) & \equiv\hat{A}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{b};\\
\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{3}\left(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}\right) & \equiv\hat{A}\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{b}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{c};\\
\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{2}\left(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}\right) & \equiv\hat{A}\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}+\hat{A}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{c}\\
 & \quad+\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{b}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{c}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

More generally, we can write
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\wedge^{k}\hat{A}^{k}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}\right) & =\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{k};\\
\wedge^{k}\hat{A}^{1}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}\right) & =\sum_{j=1}^{k}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{j}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k};\\
\wedge^{k}\hat{A}^{m}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}\right) & =\sum_{\begin{array}{c}
s_{1},...,s_{k}=0,1\\
\sum_{j}s_{j}=m\end{array}}\hat{A}^{s_{1}}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}^{s_{k}}\mathbf{v}_{k}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

In the last line, the sum is over all integers 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{j}$
\end_inset

, each being either 0 or 1, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{s_{j}}$
\end_inset

 is either 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{1}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, and the total power of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far we defined the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 only on tensors of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{m}\in\wedge^{m}V$
\end_inset

.
 Since an arbitrary element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}V$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination of such 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

elementary
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 tensors, and since we intend 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 to be a linear map, we define the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 on every element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}V$
\end_inset

 using linearity.
 For example,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2}\left(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}\wedge\mathbf{d}\right)\equiv\hat{A}\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{b}+\hat{A}\mathbf{c}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{d}.\]

\end_inset

By now it should be clear that the extension 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 is indeed a linear map 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}V\rightarrow\wedge^{m}V$

\end_inset

 on a term 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{m}\in\wedge^{m}V$

 The action of

 Also by definition we set 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{0}\equiv\hat{1}_{\wedge^{m}V}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{k}\equiv\hat{0}_{\wedge^{m}V}$

The

\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}V$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To prove the linearity of the map, we need to demonstrate not only that
 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 maps linear combinations into linear combinations (this is obvious), but
 also that the result of the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 on a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\wedge^{m}V$
\end_inset

 does not depend on the particular representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 through terms of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{m}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we need to check that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{k}\left(\omega\wedge\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge\omega'\right)=-{\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{k}}\left(\omega\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\omega'\right),\]

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

\end_inset

 are arbitrary tensors such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge\omega'\in\wedge^{m}V$
\end_inset

.
 But this property is a simple consequence of the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 which can be verified by explicit computation.

\begin_inset Formula \[
\wedge^{m}{(\hat{A}\hat{B})}^{m}=\bigl(\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{m}\bigr)\bigl(\wedge^{m}\hat{B}^{m}\bigr).\]

\end_inset

 For example, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \wedge^{2}{(\hat{A}\hat{B})}^{2}\left(\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\right)=\hat{A}\hat{B}\mathbf{u}\wedge\hat{A}\hat{B}\mathbf{v}\\

This property is a direct consequence of the definition of the operator

\end_inset

 therefore 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\wedge^{m}{(\hat{A}\hat{B})}^{m}\bigl(\bigwedge_{j=1}^{k}\mathbf{v}_{j}\bigr) & =\bigwedge_{j=1}^{k}\hat{A}\hat{B}\mathbf{v}_{j},\\

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement 4:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The following identity holds for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\in\textrm{End }V$
\end_inset

 and for any vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\,|\,1\leq j\leq m\right\} $
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

=\wedge^{m+1}\hat{A}^{k}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{m}\wedge\mathbf{u}\right).\end{align*}

\end_inset

For example,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2}\left(\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\right)\wedge\mathbf{w}+\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1}\left(\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\right)\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{w}=\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{2}\left(\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{w}\right).\label{eq:example 223}\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m+1}\hat{A}^{k}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{m}\wedge\mathbf{u}\right)$
\end_inset

 is a sum of terms where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 acts 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 times on the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

.
 We can gather all terms containing 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and separately all terms containing 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

, and we will get the required expressions.
 Here is an explicit calculation for the given example:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2}\left(\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\right)\wedge\mathbf{w} & =\hat{A}\mathbf{u}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{w};\\
\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1}\left(\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\right)\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{w} & =\bigl(\hat{A}\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{u}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}\bigr)\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{w}.\end{align*}

The formula\InsetSpace ~

\begin_layout Standard
It should now be clear how the proof proceeds in the general case.
 A formal proof using Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:lambda m a k def}

 Applying Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:lambda m a k def}

\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}$
\end_inset

 We can consider terms where 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{m+1}=0$
\end_inset

 separately from terms where 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{m+1}=1$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

\begin_layout Subsection
* Index notation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us briefly note how the multilinear action such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed in the index notation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose that the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 has the index representation 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}^{j}$
\end_inset

 in a fixed basis.
 The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 acts in the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}V$
\end_inset

; tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 in that space are represented in the index notation by totally antisymmetric
 arrays with 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 indices, such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{i_{1}...i_{m}}$
\end_inset

.
 An operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}\in\text{End}\left(\wedge^{m}V\right)$
\end_inset

 must be therefore represented by an array with 
\begin_inset Formula $2m$
\end_inset

 indices, 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i_{1}...i_{m}}^{j_{1}...j_{m}}$
\end_inset

, which is totally antisymmetric with respect to the indices 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ i_{s}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and separately with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ j_{s}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us begin with 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{m}$
\end_inset

 as the simplest case.
 The action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{m}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is written in the index notation as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
[\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{m}\psi]^{i_{1}...i_{m}}=\sum_{j_{1},...,j_{m}=1}^{N}A_{j_{1}}^{i_{1}}...A_{j_{m}}^{i_{m}}\psi^{j_{1}...j_{m}}.\]

\end_inset

This array is totally antisymmetric in 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{m}$
\end_inset

 as usual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another example is the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{1}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
[\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{1}\psi]^{i_{1}...i_{m}}=\sum_{s=1}^{m}\sum_{j=1}^{N}A_{j}^{i_{s}}\psi^{i_{1}...i_{s-1}ji_{s+1}...i_{m}}.\]

\end_inset

In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 acts only on the 
\begin_inset Formula $s^{\text{th}}$
\end_inset

 index of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, and we sum over all 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this way, every 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{m}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 can be written in the index notation, although the expressions become cumbersom
e.

 This definition is quite simple at first sight.
 However, if this definition is taken as fundamental then one is left with
 many questions.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{jk}$

 is the representation of a linear transformation in a basis; is the number
 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Tr}A$

 independent of the basis? Why is this particular combination of the matrix
 elements useful? (Why not compute the sum of the elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{jk}$
\end_inset

 along the other diagonal of the square, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{n}A_{(n+1-j)j}$
\end_inset

?)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To clarify the significance of the trace, I will give two other definitions
 of the trace: one through the canonical linear map 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes V^{*}\rightarrow\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 definition of the determinant in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\textrm{Tr}A=\sum_{k}\mathbf{f}_{k}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}_{k}\right).\label{eq:tr def 0}\end{equation}

If we represent the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A$

 through the basis tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{k}^{*}$

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $

 is its dual basis,
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\sum_{k=1}^{N}A_{jk}\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{k}^{*},\]

\end_inset

then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k}^{*}(\mathbf{e}_{j})=\delta_{ij}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
\textrm{Tr}A=\sum_{j,k=1}^{N}A_{jk}\mathbf{e}_{k}^{*}(\mathbf{e}_{j})=\sum_{j,k=1}^{N}A_{jk}\delta_{kj}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}A_{jj},\]

\end_inset

 in agreement with the traditional definition.

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}=\sum_{j,k=1}^{N}A_{jk}\mathbf{e}_{j}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{k}^{*}$

\end_inset

 computed according to Eq.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{k}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}A_{jk}\mathbf{e}_{j}.\]

Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{j}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}=A_{jj}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

 & \quad+\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{B}\mathbf{e}_{j}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N},\end{align*}

\end_inset

 from the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{1}$
\end_inset

 we easily obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}(\hat{A}+\hat{B})^{1}=\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{1}+\wedge^{N}\hat{B}^{1}$

\end_inset

 Now we explicitly compute the composition 
\begin_inset Formula $(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{1})(\wedge^{N}\hat{B}^{1})$
\end_inset

 acting on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge....\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

 First, an example with 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{1})(\wedge^{N}\hat{B}^{1})\left(\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\right) & =\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{1}(\hat{B}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}+\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\hat{B}\mathbf{e}_{2})\\

 Now the general calculation:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{1})(\wedge^{N}\hat{B}^{1})\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge....\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N} & =\sum_{j=1}^{N}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\hat{B}\mathbf{e}_{j}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}\\

\end_inset

The second sum is symmetric in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$

\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Solution:

\begin_layout Standard

\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $0=\det(\hat{A}\hat{A})=(\det\hat{A})^{2}$

 Now we apply the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{1}$
\end_inset

 to a nonzero tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\in\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 twice in a row:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{1})(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{1})\omega & =(\textrm{Tr}\hat{A})^{2}\omega\\

 & =2(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{2})\omega.\end{align*}

\end_inset

(In this calculation, we omitted the terms containing 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\hat{A}=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $1\leq k\leq N$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
{(\textrm{Tr}\hat{A})}^{k}\omega=(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{1})^{k}\omega=k!(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{k})\omega.\]

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}$
\end_inset

 multiplies by the determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $(\textrm{Tr}\hat{A})^{N}=N!(\det\hat{A})=0$

 operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

an operator having a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 of eigenvectors with eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1},...,\lambda_{N}$
\end_inset

 (the eigenvalues are not necessarily all different).
 This operator can be then written in a tensor form as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{v}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{v}_{i}^{*},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{i}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the basis dual to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 The characteristic polynomial of this operator is found from
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\det(\hat{A}-x\hat{1})\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N} & =(\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}-x\mathbf{v}_{1})\wedge...\wedge(\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N}-x\mathbf{v}_{N})\\
 & =\left(\lambda_{1}-x\right)\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\left(\lambda_{N}-x\right)\mathbf{v}_{N}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Hence
\begin_inset Formula \[
Q_{\hat{A}}(x)=\left(\lambda_{1}-x\right)...\left(\lambda_{N}-x\right).\]

\end_inset

Note also that the trace of a diagonalizable operator is equal to the sum
 of the eigenvalues, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Tr}\,\hat{A}=\lambda_{1}+...+\lambda_{N}$
\end_inset

, and the determinant is equal to the product of the eigenvalues, 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}=\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}...\lambda_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 This can be easily verified by direct calculations in the eigenbasis of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

\begin_layout Standard

) By definition, an eigenvalue of an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is such a number 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\in\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 that there exists at least one vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\neq0$
\end_inset

, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}=\lambda\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 This equation is equivalent to 
\begin_inset Formula $(\hat{A}-\lambda\hat{1}_{V})\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

.
 By Corollary\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Condition-for-solvability}

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\neq0$
\end_inset

 unless 
\begin_inset Formula $\det(\hat{A}-\lambda\hat{1}_{V})=0$
\end_inset

.
 It follows that all eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 must be roots of the characteristic polynomial.
 Conversely, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is a root then 
\begin_inset Formula $\det(\hat{A}-\lambda\hat{1}_{V})=0$
\end_inset

 and hence the vector equation 
\begin_inset Formula $(\hat{A}-\lambda\hat{1}_{V})\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

 will have at least one nonzero solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 We need to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}$
\end_inset

 is a root of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\hat{A}}(x)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $k$

 We may obtain a basis in the space

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{k},\mathbf{e}_{k+1},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $

\begin_inset Formula $j=k+1$

 Now compute the characteristic polynomial:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

\end_inset

It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\hat{A}}(x)$
\end_inset

 contains the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\lambda_{0}-x\right)^{k}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

\begin_layout Subparagraph

\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For 
\begin_inset Formula $p=q=2$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

 & =[\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2}+\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1}+\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{0}]\left(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\right).\end{align*}

\end_inset

This can be easily generalized to arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $p=q$

\begin_inset Formula \[

 term with

 terms with

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 acting on the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}$

 All terms which contain

\end_inset

 operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

\begin_inset Formula $0\leq r\leq p$

 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\wedge^{p}(\hat{A}+\hat{1}_{V})^{p}=\sum_{r=0}^{p}(\wedge^{p}\hat{A}^{r}).\]

\end_inset

This is precisely the formula\InsetSpace ~
(

\begin_inset Formula $p=q$
\end_inset

 the combinatorial coefficient is trivial,
\begin_inset Formula \[
{p-r \choose p-q}={p-r \choose 0}=1.\]

\begin_layout Standard
Now we consider the general case 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq q\leq p$

 First an example: for 
\begin_inset Formula $p=2$

\begin_inset Formula $q=1$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\wedge^{2}(\hat{A}+\hat{1}_{V})^{1}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b} & =(\hat{A}+\hat{1}_{V})\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{a}\wedge(\hat{A}+\hat{1}_{V})\mathbf{b}\\
 & =2\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}+\hat{A}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{b}\\
 & =\left[{\textstyle {2 \choose 1}}(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{0})+{\textstyle {2 \choose 0}}(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1})\right]\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b},\end{align*}

\end_inset

since 
\begin_inset Formula ${2 \choose 1}=2$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula ${2 \choose 0}=1$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To prove the formula\InsetSpace ~

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Solution:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first and the third coefficients of

 are, as usual, the determinant and the trace of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

 The second coefficient is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $-{\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{2}}$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}\big[(\text{Tr}\hat{A})^{2}-\text{Tr}(\hat{A}^{2})\big].\]

\end_inset

We apply the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{1}$
\end_inset

 twice to a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 and calculate:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & (\text{Tr}\hat{A})^{2}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}=(\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{1})(\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{1})(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c})\\
 & =(\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{1})(\hat{A}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{c})\\

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First an example: suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $N=2$
\end_inset

 and that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{3}=0$
\end_inset

.
 By Theorem\InsetSpace ~
2, the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 correspond to the operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

.
 We need to show that all these operators are equal to zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider, for instance, 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2}=q_{2}\hat{1}_{\wedge^{2}V}$
\end_inset

.
 This operator raised to the power 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

 acts on a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\in\wedge^{2}V$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
{\big({\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2}}\big)}^{3}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}=\hat{A}^{3}\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}^{3}\mathbf{b}=0\]

\end_inset

since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{3}=0$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
{\big({\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2}}\big)}^{3}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}=\left(q_{2}\right)^{3}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}.\]

\end_inset

 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{2}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Now consider 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1}$
\end_inset

 to the power 
\begin_inset Formula $3$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
{\big({\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1}}\big)}^{3}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}=\hat{A}^{2}\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{b}+\hat{A}\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}^{2}\mathbf{b}\]

\end_inset

(all other terms vanish because 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{3}=0$
\end_inset

).
 It is clear that the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1}$
\end_inset

 to the power 
\begin_inset Formula $6$
\end_inset

 vanishes because there will be at least a third power of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 acting on each vector.
 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 as well.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now a general argument.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 be a positive integer such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{p}=0$
\end_inset

, and consider the 
\begin_inset Formula $(pN)$
\end_inset

-th power of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq1$
\end_inset

.
 We will prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{k})^{pN}=\hat{0}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 is a multiplication by a number, from 
\begin_inset Formula $(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{k})^{pN}=0$
\end_inset

 it will follow that 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 is a zero operator in 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq1$
\end_inset

.
 If all the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}$
\end_inset

 of the characteristic polynomial vanish, we will have 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\hat{A}}\left(x\right)=\left(-x\right)^{N}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{k})^{pN}=\hat{0}$
\end_inset

, consider the action of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{k})^{pN}$
\end_inset

 on a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}\in\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

.
 By definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

, this operator is a sum of terms of the form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}^{s_{1}}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}^{s_{N}}\mathbf{e}_{N},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{j}=0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{j}=1$
\end_inset

 are chosen such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{N}s_{j}=k$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the same operator raised to the power 
\begin_inset Formula $pN$
\end_inset

 is expressed as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{k})^{pN}=\sum_{(s_{1},...,s_{n})}\hat{A}^{s_{1}}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}^{s_{N}}\mathbf{e}_{N},\label{eq:sum pN}\end{equation}

\end_inset

where now 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{j}$
\end_inset

 are non-negative integers, 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq s_{j}\leq pN$
\end_inset

, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{N}s_{j}=kpN$
\end_inset

.
 It is impossible that all 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{j}$
\end_inset

 in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:sum pN}

\end_inset

) are less than 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

, because then we would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{N}s_{j}<Np$
\end_inset

, which would contradict the condition 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{N}s_{j}=kpN$
\end_inset

 (since 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq1$
\end_inset

 by construction).
 So each term of the sum in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:sum pN}

\end_inset

) contains at least a 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

-th power of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $(\hat{A})^{p}=0$
\end_inset

, each term in the sum in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:sum pN}

\end_inset

) vanishes.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{k})^{pN}=0$
\end_inset

 as required.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The converse statement is also true: If the characteristic polynomial of
 an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\hat{A}}(x)=\left(-x\right)^{N}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is nilpotent.
 This follows easily from the Cayley-Hamilton theorem (see below), which
 states that 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\hat{A}}(\hat{A})=0$
\end_inset

, so we obtain immediately 
\begin_inset Formula $(\hat{A})^{N}=0$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

 is nilpotent.
 We find that one cannot distinguish a nilpotent operator from the zero
 operator by looking only at the characteristic polynomial.

\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 The next-to-top exterior power space, 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N-1}V$
\end_inset

, has the same dimension as 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and is therefore quite useful since it is a space, in some special sense,
 associated with

 We will now find several important uses of this space.

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen that a linear operator in the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 is equivalent to multiplication by a number.
 We can reformulate this statement by saying that the space of linear operators
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 is canonically isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, the space of linear operators in 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N-1}V$
\end_inset

 is canonically isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{End}\, V$
\end_inset

, the space of linear operators in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 The isomorphism map will be denoted by the superscript 
\begin_inset Formula $^{\wedge T}$

 We will begin by defining this map explicitly.

\begin_layout Standard

 with

 operator
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

 is canonically defined by the formula 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\big(\hat{X}^{\wedge T}\omega\big)\wedge\mathbf{v}\equiv\omega\wedge\hat{X}\mathbf{v},\]

which must hold for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\wedge^{N-1}V$

 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Y}\in\text{End}(\wedge^{N-1}V)$

 is a linear operator then its exterior transpose 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Y}^{\wedge T}\in\text{End}\, V$

 is defined by the formula
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We need to check that the definition makes sense, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
that the operators defined
 by these formulas exist and are uniquely defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement 1:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The exterior transpose operators are well-defined, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
they exist, are unique,
 and are linear operators in the respective spaces.
 The exterior transposition has the linearity property
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\hat{A}+\lambda\hat{B})^{\wedge T}=\hat{A}^{\wedge T}+\lambda\hat{B}^{\wedge T}.\]

\end_inset

If 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}\in\textrm{End}\, V$
\end_inset

 is an exterior transpose of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Y}\in\text{End}\left(\wedge^{N-1}V\right)$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}=\hat{Y}^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

, then also conversely 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Y}=\hat{X}^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We need to show that the formula 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\big(\hat{X}^{\wedge T}\omega\big)\wedge\mathbf{v}\equiv\omega\wedge\hat{X}\mathbf{v}\]

\end_inset

actually defines an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

 uniquely when 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}\in\textrm{End}\, V$
\end_inset

 is a given operator.
 Let us fix a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\wedge^{N-1}V$
\end_inset

; to find 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}^{\wedge T}\omega$
\end_inset

 we need to determine a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\in\wedge^{N-1}V$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\wedge\mathbf{v}=\omega\wedge\hat{X}\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

.
 When we find such a 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

, we will also show that it is unique; then we will have shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}^{\wedge T}\omega\equiv\psi$
\end_inset

 is well-defined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An explicit computation of the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 can be performed in terms of a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 A basis in the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N-1}V$
\end_inset

 is formed by the set of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 tensors of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}_{i}\equiv\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{i-1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{i+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is the exterior product of the basis vectors without the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{i}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq i\leq N$
\end_inset

).
 In the notation of Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Computing-the-dual}

\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{\omega}_{i}=*(\mathbf{e}_{i})(-1)^{i-1}$
\end_inset

.
 It is sufficient to determine the components of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 in this basis,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi=\sum_{i=1}^{N}c_{i}\boldsymbol{\omega}_{i}.\]

\end_inset

 Taking the exterior product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{i}$
\end_inset

, we find that only the term with 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 survives,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi\wedge\mathbf{e}_{i}=(-1)^{N-i}c_{i}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

Therefore, the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 is uniquely determined from the condition 
\begin_inset Formula \[
c_{i}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}=(-1)^{N-i}\psi\wedge\mathbf{e}_{i}{\lyxbuildrel!\above=}(-1)^{N-i}\omega\wedge\hat{X}\mathbf{e}_{i}.\]

\end_inset

Since the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}$
\end_inset

 is given, we know all 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}\mathbf{e}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and can compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge\hat{X}\mathbf{e}_{i}\in\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

.
 So we find that every coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 is uniquely determined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is seen from the above formula that each coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}$
\end_inset

 depends linearly on the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the linearity property holds,
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\hat{A}+\lambda\hat{B})^{\wedge T}=\hat{A}^{\wedge T}+\lambda\hat{B}^{\wedge T}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The linearity of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

 follows straightforwardly from the identity
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\big(\hat{X}^{\wedge T}(\omega+\lambda\omega^{\prime})\big)\wedge\mathbf{v} & {\lyxbuildrel!\above=}\left(\omega+\lambda\omega^{\prime}\right)\wedge\hat{X}\mathbf{v}\\
 & =\omega\wedge\hat{X}\mathbf{v}+\lambda\omega^{\prime}\wedge\hat{X}\mathbf{v}\\
 & {\lyxbuildrel!\above=}(\hat{X}^{\wedge T}\omega)\wedge\mathbf{v}+\lambda(\hat{X}^{\wedge T}\omega^{\prime})\wedge\mathbf{v}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

In the same way we prove the existence, the uniqueness, and the linearity
 of the exterior transpose of an operator from 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{End}(\wedge^{N-1}V)$
\end_inset

.
 It is then clear that the transpose of the transpose is again the original
 operator.
 Details left as exercise.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Note that the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N-1}V$
\end_inset

 is has the same dimension as 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 but is 
\emph on
not
\emph default
 canonically isomorphic to 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Rather, an element 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\in\wedge^{N-1}V$
\end_inset

 naturally acts by exterior multiplication on a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 and yields a tensor from 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 is a linear map 
\begin_inset Formula $V\rightarrow\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

, and we may express this as 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N-1}V\cong V^{*}\otimes\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

.
 Nevertheless, as we will now show, the exterior transpose map allows us
 to establish that the space of linear operators in 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N-1}V$
\end_inset

 is canonically isomorphic to the space of linear operators in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 We will use this isomorphism extensively in the following sections.
 A formal statement follows.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_layout Standard
The spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{End}(\wedge^{N-1}V)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{End}\, V$
\end_inset

 are canonically isomorphic.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The map 
\begin_inset Formula $^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

 between these spaces is one-to-one since no two different operators are
 mapped to the same operator.
 If two different operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A},\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 had the same exterior transpose, we would have 
\begin_inset Formula $(\hat{A}-\hat{B})^{\wedge T}=0$
\end_inset

 and yet 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}-\hat{B}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 There exists at least one 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\wedge^{N-1}V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\wedge(\hat{A}-\hat{B})\mathbf{v}\neq0$
\end_inset

, and then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=\big((\hat{A}-\hat{B})^{\wedge T}\omega\big)\wedge\mathbf{v}=\omega\wedge(\hat{A}-\hat{B})\mathbf{v}\neq0,\]

\end_inset

which is a contradiction.
 The map 
\begin_inset Formula $^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

 is linear (Statement\InsetSpace ~
1).
 Therefore, it is an isomorphism between the vector spaces 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{End}\left(\wedge^{N-1}V\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{End}\, V$
\end_inset

 Specifically, if

 This is precisely the map we have been using in the previous section to
 define the determinant.

Let us see how the exterior transposition
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{exterior transposition!in index notation}

\end_inset

 is expressed in the index notation.
 (Below we will not use the resulting formulas.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\in\text{End}\, V$
\end_inset

 is given in the index notation by a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{i}^{j}$
\end_inset

, the exterior transpose 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{\wedge T}\in\text{End}\left(\wedge^{N-1}V\right)$
\end_inset

 is represented by an array 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{i_{1}...i_{N-1}}^{j_{1}...j_{N-1}}$
\end_inset

, which is totally antisymmetric with respect to its 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

 lower and upper indices separately.
 The action of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}\equiv\hat{A}^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

 on a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\in\wedge^{N-1}V$
\end_inset

 is written in the index notation as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{i_{s}}B_{i_{1}...i_{N-1}}^{j_{1}...j_{N-1}}\psi^{i_{1}...i_{N-1}}.\]

\end_inset

(Here we did not introduce any combinatorial factors; the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N-1\right)!$
\end_inset

 will therefore appear at the end of the calculation.)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By definition of the exterior transpose, for any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 and for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\in\wedge^{N-1}V$
\end_inset

 we must have
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\hat{B}\psi)\wedge\mathbf{v}=\psi\wedge(\hat{A}\mathbf{v}).\]

\end_inset

Using the index representation of the exterior product through the projection
 operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{E}$
\end_inset

 (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Exterior-product-in-index}

\end_inset

), we represent the equation above in the the index notation as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \sum_{i,i_{s},j_{s}}E_{j_{1}...j_{N-1}i}^{k_{1}...k_{N}}(B_{i_{1}...i_{N-1}}^{j_{1}...j_{N-1}}\psi^{i_{1}...i_{N-1}})v^{i}\\
 & \;=\sum_{j_{s},i,j}E_{j_{1}...j_{N-1}j}^{k_{1}...k_{N}}\psi^{j_{1}...j_{N-1}}(A_{i}^{j}v^{i}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

We may simplify this to 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \sum_{i,i_{s},j_{s}}\varepsilon_{j_{1}...j_{N-1}i}(B_{i_{1}...i_{N-1}}^{j_{1}...j_{N-1}}\psi^{i_{1}...i_{N-1}})v^{i}\\
 & \;=\sum_{i_{s},i,j}\varepsilon_{i_{1}...i_{N-1}j}\psi^{i_{1}...i_{N-1}}(A_{i}^{j}v^{i}),\end{align*}

\end_inset

because 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{j_{1}...j_{N}}^{k_{1}...k_{N}}=\varepsilon_{j_{1}...j_{N}}\varepsilon^{k_{1}...k_{N}}$
\end_inset

, and we may cancel the common factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{k_{1}...k_{N}}$
\end_inset

 whose indices are not being summed over.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the equation above should hold for arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi^{i_{1}...i_{N-1}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $v^{i}$
\end_inset

, the equation with the corresponding 
\emph on
free
\emph default
 indices 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{s}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 should hold: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{j_{s}}\varepsilon_{j_{1}...j_{N-1}i}B_{i_{1}...i_{N-1}}^{j_{1}...j_{N-1}}=\sum_{j}\varepsilon_{i_{1}...i_{N-1}j}A_{i}^{j}.\label{eq:B A connection}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This equation can be solved for 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 as follows.
 We note that the 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 symbol in the left-hand side of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:B A connection}

\end_inset

) has one free index, 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

.
 Let us therefore multiply with an additional 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and sum over that index; this will yield the projection operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{E}$
\end_inset

 (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Exterior-product-in-index}

\end_inset

).
 Namely, we multiply both sides of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:B A connection}

\end_inset

) with 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon^{k_{1}...k_{N-1}i}$
\end_inset

 and sum over 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\sum_{j,i}\varepsilon^{k_{1}...k_{N-1}i}\varepsilon_{i_{1}...i_{N-1}j}A_{i}^{j} & =\sum_{j_{s},i}\varepsilon^{k_{1}...k_{N-1}i}\varepsilon_{j_{1}...j_{N-1}i}B_{i_{1}...i_{N-1}}^{j_{1}...j_{N-1}}\\
 & =\sum_{j_{s}}E_{j_{1}...j_{N-1}}^{k_{1}...k_{N-1}}B_{i_{1}...i_{N-1}}^{j_{1}...j_{N-1}},\end{align*}

\end_inset

where in the last line we used the definition\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:E tilda def}

\end_inset

)--(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:E def}

\end_inset

) of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{E}$
\end_inset

.
 Now we note that the right-hand side is the index representation of the
 product of the operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{E}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 (both operators act in 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N-1}V$
\end_inset

).
 The left-hand side is also an operator in 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N-1}V$
\end_inset

; denoting this operator for brevity by 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}$
\end_inset

, we rewrite the equation as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{E}\hat{B}=\hat{X}\in\text{End}\left(\wedge^{N-1}V\right).\]

\end_inset

Using the property 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{E}=(N-1)!\hat{1}_{\wedge^{N-1}V}\]

\end_inset

(see Exercise in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Exterior-product-in-index}

\end_inset

), we may solve the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{E}\hat{B}=\hat{X}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{B}=\frac{1}{(N-1)!}\hat{X}.\]

\end_inset

Hence, the components of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}\equiv\hat{A}^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

 are expressed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{i_{1}...i_{N-1}}^{k_{1}...k_{N-1}}=\frac{1}{(N-1)!}\sum_{j,i}\varepsilon^{k_{1}...k_{N-1}i}\varepsilon_{i_{1}...i_{N-1}j}A_{i}^{j}.\]

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

 are
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\big(\hat{A}^{\wedge T}\big)_{l_{1}...l_{N-2}}^{k_{1}...k_{N-2}} & =\frac{1}{2!(N-2)!}\sum_{j_{s},i_{s}}\varepsilon^{k_{1}...k_{N-2}i_{1}i_{2}}\varepsilon_{l_{1}...l_{N-2}j_{1}j_{2}}A_{i_{1}i_{2}}^{j_{1}j_{2}}\\

\end_inset

Let us check that this array of components is the same as that representing
 the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{1}_{\wedge^{N-2}V}$
\end_inset

.
 We note that the expression above is the same as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{\left(N-2\right)!}E_{l_{1}...l_{N-2}}^{k_{1}...k_{N-2}},\]

\end_inset

where the numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $E_{l_{1}...l_{n}}^{k_{1}...k_{n}}$

 are defined by Eqs.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:E tilda def}

 Since the operator

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N-2\right)!\hat{1}_{\wedge^{N-2}V}$

While we proved that operators like

\end_inset

 are well-defined, we still have not obtained any explicit formulas for
 these operators.
 We will now compute these operators explicitly because they play an important
 role in the further development of the theory.
 It will turn out that every operator of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $(\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{p})^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

 is a 
\emph on

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

 with coefficients that are known if we know the characteristic polynomial
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example 1:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us compute 
\begin_inset Formula $(\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{1})^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

.
 We consider, as a first example, a three-dimen\SpecialChar \-

al (
\begin_inset Formula $N=3$
\end_inset

) vector space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and a linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\in\text{End}\, V$
\end_inset

.
 We are interested in the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1})^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

.
 By definition of the exterior transpose, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1})^{\wedge T}\mathbf{c} & =\big((\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1})(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b})\big)\wedge\mathbf{c}\\
 & =\hat{A}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

We recognize a fragment of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{1}$
\end_inset

 and write 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
(\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{1})(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}) & =\hat{A}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{c}\\
 & =(\text{Tr}\,\hat{A})\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c},\end{align*}

\end_inset

since this operator acts as multiplication by the trace of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 (Section\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-trace}

\end_inset

).
 It follows that
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1})^{\wedge T}\mathbf{c} & =(\text{Tr}\,\hat{A})\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}-\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{c}\\
 & =\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\big((\text{Tr}\,\hat{A})\mathbf{c}-\hat{A}\mathbf{c}\big).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Since this must hold for arbitrary 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}\in V$
\end_inset

, it follows that
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1})^{\wedge T}=(\text{Tr}\,\hat{A})\hat{1}_{V}-\hat{A}.\]

\end_inset

Thus we have computed the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1})^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

 in terms of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 and the trace of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

Example 2:

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now consider the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2})^{\wedge T}$

 We have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2})^{\wedge T}\mathbf{c}=\big((\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2})(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b})\big)\wedge\mathbf{c}=\hat{A}\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}.\]

\end_inset

We recognize a fragment of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and write 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{2})(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c})=\hat{A}\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}+\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{b}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{c}+\hat{A}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{c}.\]

\end_inset

Therefore,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2})^{\wedge T}\mathbf{c} & =(\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{2})(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c})\\
 & -(\mathbf{a}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{b}+\hat{A}\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b})\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{c}\\
^{(1)}=(\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{2})(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}) & -\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1})^{\wedge T}\hat{A}\mathbf{c}\\
=\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge & \big({\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{2}}-(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1})^{\wedge T}\hat{A}\big)\mathbf{c},\end{align*}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $^{(1)}$
\end_inset

 used the definition of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1})^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2})^{\wedge T} & =(\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{2})\hat{1}_{V}-(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1})^{\wedge T}\hat{A}\\
 & =(\wedge^{3}\hat{A}^{2})\hat{1}_{V}-(\text{Tr}\,\hat{A})\hat{A}+\hat{A}\hat{A}.\end{align*}

\begin_inset Formula \[

Here, in order to provide a meaning for this formula in cases

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{0}\equiv\hat{1}$

 In the shorter notation, this is

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:

\begin_layout Standard
We use Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Extensions-of-an}

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\equiv\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N-1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $m\equiv N-1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $k\equiv p$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\bigl(\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{p}\omega\bigr)\wedge\mathbf{u}+\bigl(\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{p-1}\omega\bigr)\wedge(\hat{A}\mathbf{u})=\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{p}\left(\omega\wedge\mathbf{u}\right).\]

\end_inset

This holds for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq p\leq N-1$
\end_inset

.
 Applying the definition of the exterior transpose, we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega\wedge\bigl(\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{p}{\bigr)}^{\wedge T}\mathbf{u}+\omega\wedge\bigl(\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{p-1}{\bigr)}^{\wedge T}\hat{A}\mathbf{u}=(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{p})\omega\wedge\mathbf{u}.\]

\end_inset

Since this holds for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\wedge^{N-1}V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\in V$
\end_inset

, we obtain the required formula,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\bigl(\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{p}\bigr)^{\wedge T}+\omega\wedge\bigl(\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{p-1}\bigr)^{\wedge T}\hat{A}=(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{p})\hat{1}_{V}.\]

\end_inset

It remains to verify the case 
\begin_inset Formula $p=N$
\end_inset

.
 In that case we compute directly,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\bigl(\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-1}\omega\bigr)\wedge(\hat{A}\mathbf{u}) & =\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N-1}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{u}\\
 & =\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}\left(\omega\wedge\mathbf{u}\right).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\big({\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-1}}\big)^{\wedge T}\hat{A}=(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N})\hat{1}_{V}\equiv(\det\hat{A})\hat{1}_{V}.\]

 Once the identity is proved, one can use induction to express the operators
 
\begin_inset Formula ${\big({\wedge^{N-k}\hat{A}^{p}}\big)}^{\wedge T}$

 For instance, the identity with

 yields
\begin_inset Formula \[
{\big({\wedge^{N-2}\hat{A}^{0}}\big)}^{\wedge T}(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1})+{\big({\wedge^{N-2}\hat{A}^{1}}\big)}^{\wedge T}(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{0})=(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{1})\hat{1}_{\wedge^{k}V}.\]

Therefore
\begin_inset Formula \[
{\big({\wedge^{N-2}\hat{A}^{1}}\big)}^{\wedge T}=(\text{Tr}\hat{A})\hat{1}_{\wedge^{k}V}-\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1}.\]

\end_inset

Similarly, with 
\begin_inset Formula $k=2$

 we find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
{\big({\wedge^{N-2}\hat{A}^{2}}\big)}^{\wedge T}\negmedspace & =(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{2})\hat{1}_{\wedge^{k}V}-{\big({\wedge^{N-2}\hat{A}^{1}}\big)}^{\wedge T}(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{1})-\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2}\\

Algebraic complement of a matrix
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The algebraic complement is usually introduced in terms of matrix determinants.
 Namely, one takes a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

 and deletes the column number 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and the row number 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

.
 Then one computes the determinant of the resulting matrix and multiplies
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $(-1)^{k+l}$
\end_inset

.
 The result is the element 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{kl}$
\end_inset

 of the matrix that is the algebraic complement of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

.
 I will now show that our definition is equivalent to this one, if we interpret
 matrices as coefficients of linear operators in a basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\in\text{End}\, V$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 be a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

 be the matrix of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 in this basis.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}=\big({\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-1}}\big)^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

 and let 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{kl}$
\end_inset

 be the matrix of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 in the same basis.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{kl}$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-1\right)^{k+l}$
\end_inset

 times the determinant of the matrix obtained from 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

 by deleting the column number 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and the row number 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

, the matrix element 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{kl}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 can be computed as the coefficient in the following relation (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Computing-the-dual}

\end_inset

),
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{kl}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}=\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{k-1}\wedge(\hat{B}\mathbf{e}_{l})\wedge\mathbf{e}_{k+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}.\]

\end_inset


\begin_inset Note Note
status collapsed

\begin_layout Standard
As in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Computing-the-dual}

\end_inset

, we denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $*\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

 the tensor
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(-1\right)^{k}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{k-1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{k+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}\]

\end_inset

that contains all the basis vectors except 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}=\big({\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-1}}\big)^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
B_{kl}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}=\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{k-1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{l}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{k+1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

Now the right side can be expressed as the determinant of another operator,
 call it 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
B_{kl}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N} & =(\det\hat{X})\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}\\
=\hat{X}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge & ...\wedge\hat{X}\mathbf{e}_{k-1}\wedge\hat{X}\mathbf{e}_{k}\wedge\hat{X}\mathbf{e}_{k+1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{X}\mathbf{e}_{N},\end{align*}

\end_inset

if we define 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}$
\end_inset

 as an operator such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}\mathbf{e}_{k}\equiv\mathbf{e}_{l}$
\end_inset

 while on other basis vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}\mathbf{e}_{j}\equiv\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $j\neq k$
\end_inset

).
 Having defined 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}$
\end_inset

 in this way, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $B_{kl}=\det\hat{X}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can now determine the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{ij}$
\end_inset

 representing 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{X}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 By the definition of the matrix representation of operators,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{j}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}A_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{i},\quad\hat{X}\mathbf{e}_{j}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}X_{ij}\mathbf{e}_{i},\quad1\leq j\leq N.\]

\end_inset

It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{ij}=A_{ij}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $j\neq k$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{ik}=\delta_{il}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq i\leq N$
\end_inset

), which means that the entire 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-th column in the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

 has been replaced by a column containing zeros except for a single nonzero
 element 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{lk}=1$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to show that the determinant of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-1\right)^{k+l}$
\end_inset

 times the determinant of the matrix obtained from 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

 by deleting column 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 and row 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

.
 We may move in the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{ij}$
\end_inset

 the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-th column to the first column and the 
\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

-th row to the first row, without changing the order of any other rows and
 columns.
 This produces the sign factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-1\right)^{k+l}$
\end_inset

 but otherwise does not change the determinant.
 The result is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
B_{kl} & =\det\hat{X}=\left(-1\right)^{k+l}\det\left|\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & X_{12} & ... & X_{1N}\\
0 & * & * & *\\
\vdots & * & * & *\\
0 & * & * & *\end{array}\right|\\

* & * & *\\
* & * & *\\
* & * & *\end{array}\right|,\end{align*}

\end_inset

where the stars represent the matrix obtained from 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

 by deleting column 
\begin_inset Formula $k$

\begin_inset Formula $l$
\end_inset

, and the numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{12}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $X_{1N}$
\end_inset

 do not enter the determinant.
 This is the result we needed.

\begin_layout Standard
In our approach, the algebraic complement 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\hat{A}}$
\end_inset

 of an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 comes from considering the set of 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

 operators
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}_{(k)}\equiv\big({\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-k}}\big)^{\wedge T},\quad1\leq k\leq N-1.\]

\end_inset

(For convenience we might define 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{(N)}\equiv\hat{1}_{V}$
\end_inset

.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operators  
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{(k)}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as polynomials in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 through the identity (Lemma\InsetSpace ~
1 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-algebraic-complement}

\end_inset

)
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}_{(k)}\hat{A}+\hat{A}_{(k-1)}=q_{k-1}\hat{1},\quad q_{j}\equiv\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-j}.\]

\end_inset

The numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}$
\end_inset

 introduced here are the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

; for instance, 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}\equiv q_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Tr}\hat{A}\equiv q_{N-1}$
\end_inset

.
 It follows by induction (Exercise\InsetSpace ~
2 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-algebraic-complement}

\end_inset

) that
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{A}_{(N-k)} & =q_{N-k}\hat{1}-q_{N-k+1}\hat{A}+...\\
 & \quad+q_{N-1}(-\hat{A})^{k-1}+(-\hat{A})^{k}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The algebraic complement is 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\hat{A}}\equiv\hat{A}_{1}$
\end_inset

, but it appears natural to study the properties of all the operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{(k)}$
\end_inset

.
 (The operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{(k)}$
\end_inset

 do not seem to have an established name for 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq2$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement\InsetSpace ~

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of the algebraic complement,

\begin_inset Formula \[
\wedge^{N}\tilde{\hat{A}}^{k}=(\det\hat{A})^{k-1}(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-k})\equiv q_{0}^{k-1}q_{k}.\]

\end_inset

For instance, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\text{Tr}\,\tilde{\hat{A}} & =\wedge^{N}\tilde{\hat{A}}^{1}=q_{1}=\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-1},\\
\det\tilde{\hat{A}} & =\wedge^{N}\tilde{\hat{A}}^{N}=q_{0}^{N-1}q_{N}=(\det\hat{A})^{N-1}.\end{align*}

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us first assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}\equiv q_{0}\neq0$
\end_inset

 We use the property 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\tilde{\hat{A}}=q_{0}\hat{1}$
\end_inset

 (Lemma\InsetSpace ~
2 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-algebraic-complement}

\end_inset

) and the multiplicativity of determinants to find
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\det(\tilde{\hat{A}}-\lambda\hat{1})q_{0} & =\det(q_{0}\hat{1}-\lambda\hat{A})=(-\lambda)^{N}\det(\hat{A}-\frac{q_{0}}{\lambda}\hat{1})\\
 & =(-\lambda^{N})Q_{\hat{A}}(\frac{q_{0}}{\lambda}),\end{align*}

\end_inset

hence the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\hat{A}}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
Q_{\tilde{\hat{A}}}(\lambda) & \equiv\det(\tilde{\hat{A}}-\lambda\hat{1})=\frac{(-\lambda^{N})}{q_{0}}Q_{\hat{A}}(\frac{q_{0}}{\lambda})\\
 & =\frac{(-\lambda)^{N}}{q_{0}}\left[\left(-\frac{q_{0}}{\lambda}\right)^{N}+q_{N-1}\left(-\frac{q_{0}}{\lambda}\right)^{N-1}+...+q_{0}\right]\\
 & =(-\lambda)^{N}+q_{1}(-\lambda)^{N-1}+q_{2}q_{0}\left(-\lambda\right)^{N-2}+...+q_{0}^{N-1}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

This agrees with the required formula.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to prove the case 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}\equiv\det\hat{A}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Although this result could be achieved as a limit of nonzero 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

, it is instructive to see a direct proof without using the assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}\neq0$
\end_inset

 or taking limits.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and the expression
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\wedge^{N}\tilde{\hat{A}}^{k})\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

This expression contains 
\begin_inset Formula ${N \choose k}$
\end_inset

 terms of the form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\hat{A}}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\tilde{\hat{A}}\mathbf{v}_{k}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\hat{A}}$
\end_inset

 is applied only to 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 vectors.
 Using the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\hat{A}}$
\end_inset

, we can rewrite such a term as follows.
 First, we use the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\hat{A}}$
\end_inset

 to write
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\hat{A}}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\psi=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\big({\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-1}}\big)\psi,\]

\end_inset

for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\in\wedge^{N-1}V$
\end_inset

.
 In our case, we use
\begin_inset Formula \[
\psi\equiv\tilde{\hat{A}}\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\tilde{\hat{A}}\mathbf{v}_{k}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\]

\end_inset

and find
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\hat{A}}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\psi=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\hat{A}\tilde{\hat{A}}\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\tilde{\hat{A}}\mathbf{v}_{k}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{k+1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

By assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}=0$
\end_inset

, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\tilde{\hat{A}}=0=\tilde{\hat{A}}\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 (since 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\hat{A}}$
\end_inset

, being a polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, commutes with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

) and thus 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\wedge^{N}\tilde{\hat{A}}^{k})\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}=0,\quad k\geq2.\]

\end_inset

For 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1$
\end_inset

 we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\hat{A}}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\psi=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

Summing 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 such terms, we obtain the same expression as that in the definition of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-1}$
\end_inset

, hence
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\wedge^{N}\tilde{\hat{A}}^{1})\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}=\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-1}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

This concludes the proof for the case 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}=0$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}_{(k)}\mathbf{v}_{j}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\]

\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $N-k+1\leq j\leq N$
\end_inset

.
 The same argument holds for every other term.
 Therefore
\begin_inset Formula \[
\text{Tr}\hat{A}_{(k)}\omega=k\,(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-k})\omega=kq_{k}\omega.\]

\end_inset

Since this holds for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\wedge^{N}V$

\end_layout

\end_inset

 This algorithm is more economical compared with the computation of

Statement 3: (Leverrier's algorithm)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Leverrier's algorithm}

\end_inset

The coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{k}\equiv q_{N-k}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq k\leq N$
\end_inset

) of the characteristic polynomial of an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 can be computed together with the operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{(j)}$
\end_inset

 by starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{(N)}\equiv\hat{1}_{V}$
\end_inset

 and using the descending recurrence relation for 
\begin_inset Formula $j=N-1$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
q_{j} & =\frac{1}{N-j}\text{Tr}\,[\hat{A}\hat{A}_{(j+1)}],\nonumber \\
\hat{A}_{(j)} & =q_{j}\hat{1}-\hat{A}\hat{A}_{(j+1)}.\label{eq:Aq Leverrier}\end{align}

\end_inset

At the end of the calculation, we will have
\begin_inset Formula \[
q_{0}=\det\hat{A},\quad\hat{A}_{(1)}=\tilde{\hat{A}},\quad\hat{A}_{(0)}=0.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the beginning of the recurrence, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
j=N-1,\quad q_{N-1}=\frac{1}{N-j}\text{Tr}\,[\hat{A}\hat{A}_{(j+1)}]=\text{Tr}\hat{A},\]

\end_inset

which is correct.
 The recurrence relation\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Aq Leverrier}

\end_inset

) for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{(j)}$
\end_inset

 coincides with the result of Lemma\InsetSpace ~
1 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-algebraic-complement}

\end_inset

 and thus yields at each step 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 the correct operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{(j)}$
\end_inset

 --- as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}$
\end_inset

 was computed correctly at that step.
 So it remains to verify that 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}$
\end_inset

 is computed correctly.
 Taking the trace of Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:Aq Leverrier}

\end_inset

) and using 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Tr}\,\hat{1}=N$
\end_inset

, we get
\begin_inset Formula \[
\text{Tr}\,[A\hat{A}_{(j+1)}]=Nq_{j}-\text{Tr}\hat{A}_{(j)}.\]

\end_inset

We now substitute for 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Tr}\hat{A}_{(j)}$
\end_inset

 the result of Statement\InsetSpace ~
2 and find
\begin_inset Formula \[
\text{Tr}\,[A\hat{A}_{(j+1)}]=Nq_{j}-jq_{j}=\left(N-j\right)q_{j}.\]

\end_inset

Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{j}$
\end_inset

 is also computed correctly from the previously known 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{(j+1)}$
\end_inset

 at each step 
\begin_inset Formula $j$

 When we substitute the operator

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\hat{A}}(\lambda)$

\begin_inset Formula \[
Q_{\hat{A}}(\hat{A})=(\det\hat{A})\hat{1}_{V}+(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-1})(-\hat{A})+...+(-\hat{A})^{N}.\]

\end_inset

We note that this expression is similar to that for the algebraic complement
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 (see Exercise\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-algebraic-complement}

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

by Lemma\InsetSpace ~

Remark:

\begin_layout Standard
While it is true that the characteristic polynomial vanishes on 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

 A polynomial of a lower degree may vanish on 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 A trivial example of this is given by an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}=\alpha\hat{1}$

 The characteristic polynomial of

 In agreement with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, 
\begin_inset Formula $(\alpha\hat{1}-\hat{A})^{N}=\hat{0}$

\begin_layout Standard
Let us fix

(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:identity p q}

\begin_inset Formula $1\leq p\leq N-k$
\end_inset

 These 
\begin_inset Formula $N-k$

\begin_inset Formula \[

In the

\begin_inset Formula $r<p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}\hat{A}^{q}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq q\leq k$
\end_inset

 Therefore, these equations can be used to express 
\begin_inset Formula ${\big({\wedge^{N-k}\hat{A}^{p}}\big)}^{\wedge T}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq p\leq N-k$
\end_inset

 through the operators

\end_inset

 explicitly as polynomials.
 Substituting these expressions into Eq.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $k$

 identically vanishing polynomials in the

 operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}\hat{A}^{q}$
\end_inset

 These polynomials can be considered as a system of polynomial equations
 in the variables 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\alpha}_{q}\equiv\wedge^{k}\hat{A}^{q}$

 (As an exercise, you may verify that all the operators

 Using the properties

\big({\wedge^{1}\hat{A}^{1}}\big)^{\wedge T}(\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2}) & =q_{0}\hat{1}_{\wedge^{2}V}.\end{align*}

Let us denote for brevity

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{\alpha}_{2}\equiv\wedge^{2}\hat{A}^{2}$

(q_{2}\hat{1}-\hat{\alpha}_{1})\hat{\alpha}_{2} & =q_{0}\hat{1}.\end{align*}

We can now express

\begin_layout Standard
Let

 Since linear operators can be multiplied, it is straightforward to evaluate

 and other powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

 For example, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

 can be substituted instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 into the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)=2+3x+4x^{2}$

\begin_layout Standard
Another familiar function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

 is the inverse operator, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{-1}$

 Clearly, we can evaluate a polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 as well (if 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 exists).
 It is interesting to ask whether we can evaluate an arbitrary function
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

; for instance, whether we can raise 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 to a non-integer power, or compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\ln(\hat{A})$

\begin_inset Formula $\cos(\hat{A})$

 Generally, can we substitute 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in an arbitrary function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 and evaluate an oper\SpecialChar \-

\begin_inset Formula $f(\hat{A})$

 There are two situations when

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{i}=\lambda_{i}\mathbf{e}_{i}.\]

\end_inset

In this case, we simply define 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 as the linear operator that acts on the basis vectors as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(\hat{A})\mathbf{e}_{i}\equiv f(\lambda_{i})\mathbf{e}_{i}.\]

\end_inset

the function

 is the linear operator defined by 
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

provided that 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$

 is well-defined at the points 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,N$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This definition might appear to be 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cheating
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 since we simply substituted the eigenvalues into 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $f(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 in some 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

natural
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 way.
 However, the result is reasonable since we, in effect, define 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 separately in each eigenspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Span}\,\{\mathbf{e}_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 acts as multiplication by 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$

 It is natural to define 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 in each eigenspace as multiplication by 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\lambda_{i})$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second situation is when 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 is an

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{analytic function}

\end_inset

, that is, a function represented by a power series 
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

such that the series converges to the value 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 Further, we need this series to converge for a sufficiently wide range
 of values of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 such that all eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 are within that range.
 Then one can show that the oper\SpecialChar \-
ator-valued series
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(\hat{A})=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}(\hat{A})^{n}\]

\end_inset

converges.
 The technical details of this proof are beyond the scope of this book;
 one needs to define the limit of a sequence of operators and other notions
 studied in functional analysis.
 Here is a simple argument that gives a condition for convergence.
 Suppose that the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is diagonalizable and has eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 and the corresponding eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,N$
\end_inset

) such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 has a tensor representation
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{v}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{v}_{i}^{*}.\]

\end_inset

Note that
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}^{n}=\left[\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{v}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{v}_{i}^{*}\right]^{n}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}^{n}\mathbf{v}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{v}_{i}^{*}\]

\end_inset

 due to the property of the dual basis, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}^{*}(\mathbf{v}_{j})=\delta_{ij}$
\end_inset

.
 So if the series 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}x^{n}$
\end_inset

 converges for every eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 then the tensor-valued series also converges and yields a new tensor
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}(\hat{A})^{n} & =\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}^{n}\mathbf{v}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{v}_{i}^{*}\\
 & =\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}\lambda^{n}\right]\mathbf{v}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{v}_{i}^{*}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

This argument indicates at least one case where the oper\SpecialChar \-
ator-valued power
 series surely converges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Instead of performing an in-depth study of oper\SpecialChar \-
ator-valued power series,
 I will restrict myself to considering 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

formal power series
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 containing a parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, that is, infinite power series in 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 considered without regard for convergence.
 Let us discuss this idea in more detail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By definition, a 
\series bold
formal power series
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{formal power series}

\end_inset

 (FPS) is an infinite sequence of numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2},...\right)$
\end_inset

.
 This sequence, however, is written as if it were a power series in a parameter
 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
c_{0}+c_{1}t+c_{2}t^{2}+...=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}t^{n}.\]

\end_inset

It appears that we need to calculate the sum of the above series.
 However, while we manipulate an FPS, we 
\emph on
do not
\emph default
 assign any value to 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

 and thus do not have to consider the issue of convergence of the resulting
 infinite series.
 Hence, we work with an FPS as with an algebraic expression containing a
 variable 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, an expression that we do not evaluate (although we may simplify it).
 These expressions can be manipulated term by term, so that, for example,
 the sum and the product of two FPS are always defined; the result is another
 FPS.
 Thus, the notation for FPS should be understood as a convenient shorthand
 that simplifies working with FPS, rather than an actual sum of an infinite
 series.
 At the same time, the notation for FPS makes it easy to evaluate the actual
 infinite series when the need arises.
 Therefore, any results obtained using FPS will hold whenever the series
 converges.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now I will use the formal power series to define 
\begin_inset Formula $f(t\hat{A})$

\end_inset

holds for formal power series.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since

 Here both sides are interpreted as formal power series.
 Deduce that

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{i}^{*}$

\begin_layout Standard
It is sufficient to prove that the terms multiplying

 coincide for each

 We note that the square of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

 & =\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}^{2}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{i}^{*}\end{align*}

\end_inset

because 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{i}^{*}(\mathbf{e}_{j})=\delta_{ij}$
\end_inset

 In this way we can compute any power of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 Therefore, the term in the left side of Eq.\InsetSpace ~

Now that we know when an oper\SpecialChar \-

\begin_inset Formula $f(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

? The first definition requires us to diagonalize 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 (this is already a lot of work since we need to determine every eigenvector).
 Moreover, Definition\InsetSpace ~
1 does not apply when 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is non-diagonalizable.
 On the other hand, Definition\InsetSpace ~
2 requires us to evaluate infinitely many
 terms of a  power series.
 Is there a simpler way?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There is a situation when 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\hat{A})$

 can be computed without such effort.
 Let us first consider a simple example where the operator

\end_inset

 happens to be a projector
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{projector}

\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $(\hat{A})^{2}=\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, any power of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is again equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 It is then easy to compute a power series in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}(\hat{A})^{n}=c_{0}\hat{1}+\bigl(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}c_{n}\bigr)\hat{A}.\]

\end_inset

In this way we can compute any analytic function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 (as long as the series 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}c_{n}$
\end_inset

 converges).
 For example,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\cos\hat{A} & =\hat{1}-\frac{1}{2!}(\hat{A})^{2}+\frac{1}{4!}(\hat{A})^{4}-...=\hat{1}-\frac{1}{2!}\hat{A}+\frac{1}{4!}\hat{A}-...\\
 & =(1-\frac{1}{2!}+\frac{1}{4!}-...)\hat{A}+\hat{1}-\hat{A}\\
 & =\left[(\cos1)-1\right]\hat{A}+\hat{1}.\end{align*}

\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,N$
\end_inset

) are known coefficients.
 The Cayley-Hamilton theorem indicates that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 satisfies the polynomial identity,
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\hat{A})^{N}=-\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}q_{N-k}\left(-1\right)^{N-k}(\hat{A})^{k}.\]

\end_inset

It follows that any power of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as a linear combination of smaller powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, a power series in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 can be reduced to a polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 of degree not larger than 
\begin_inset Formula $N-1$
\end_inset

.
 The task of computing an arbitrary function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 is then reduced to the task of determining the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 coefficients of 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)\equiv p_{0}+...+p_{N-1}x^{n-1}$
\end_inset

.
 Once the coefficients of that polynomial are found, the function can be
 evaluated as 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\hat{A})=p(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 for any operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 that has the given characteristic polynomial.

Determining the coefficients of the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 might appear to be difficult because one can get rather complicated formulas
 when one converts an arbitrary power of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 to smaller powers.
 This work can be avoided if the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 are known, by using the

\begin_layout Standard
The present task is to calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 --- equivalently, the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 --- when the characteristic polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\hat{A}}(\lambda)$
\end_inset

 is known.
 The characteristic polynomial has order 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 and hence has 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 (complex) roots, counting each root with its multiplicity.
 The eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 are roots of its characteristic polynomial, and there exists 
\emph on

 Knowing the characteristic polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\hat{A}}(\lambda)$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us first assume that the roots

 Then we have 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 different eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 The set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{i}\,|\, i=1,...,N\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent (Statement\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Linear-independence-of-eigenvectors}

\end_inset

) and hence is a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

; that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is diagonalizable.
 We will not actually need to determine the eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

; it will be sufficient that they exist.
 Let us now apply the function 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 to each of these 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 eigenvectors: we must have
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(\hat{A})\mathbf{v}_{i}=f(\lambda_{i})\mathbf{v}_{i}.\]

\end_inset

On the other hand, we may express 
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(\hat{A})\mathbf{v}_{i}=p(\hat{A})\mathbf{v}_{i}=p(\lambda_{i})\mathbf{v}_{i}.\]

\end_inset

Since the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent, the vanishing linear combination 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left[f(\lambda_{i})-p(\lambda_{i})\right]\mathbf{v}_{i}=0\]

\end_inset

must have all vanishing coefficients; hence we obtain a system of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 equations for 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 unknowns 
\begin_inset Formula $\{ p_{0},...,p_{N-1}\}$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
p_{0}+p_{1}\lambda_{i}+...+p_{N-1}\lambda_{i}^{N-1}=f(\lambda_{i}),\quad i=1,...,N.\]

\end_inset

Note that this system of equations has the Vandermonde matrix (Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-Vandermonde-matrix}

\end_inset

).
 Since by assumption all 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$

 solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\{ p_{0},...,p_{N-1}\}$
\end_inset

 exists and is unique.
 The polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)$

 to compute functions

 It can be that the characteristic polynomial has a high order due to many

 This possibility can be provided by a polynomial of a lower degree than

 Then an analytic function

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)$
\end_inset

 is defined uniquely by substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{k}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq n$
\end_inset

 through lower powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 in the series for 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

, using the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)=0$
\end_inset

.
 Consider the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{1}$
\end_inset

 that acts as multiplication by 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 This operator satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\hat{A}_{1})=0$
\end_inset

, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\hat{A}_{1})$
\end_inset

 is simplified to the same polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\hat{A}_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 Hence we must have 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\hat{A}_{1})=p(\hat{A}_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 However, 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\hat{A}_{1})$
\end_inset

 is simply the operator of multiplication by 
\begin_inset Formula $f(\lambda_{1})$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)$
\end_inset

 must be equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 when evaluated at 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Similarly, we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\lambda_{i})=f(\lambda_{i})$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,n$
\end_inset

.
 The interpolating polynomial for 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 at the points 
\begin_inset Formula $x=\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,n$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $n-1$
\end_inset

 Therefore, this polynomial must be equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)$

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$

 are different.
 To be specific, let us assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=\lambda_{2}$
\end_inset

 and that all other eigenvalues are different.
 In this case we will first solve an auxiliary problem where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}=\lambda_{1}+\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 and then take the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

.
 The equations determining the coefficients of the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)$
\end_inset

 are
\begin_inset Formula \[
p(\lambda_{1})=f(\lambda_{1}),\quad p(\lambda_{1}+\varepsilon)=f(\lambda_{1}+\varepsilon),\; p(\lambda_{3})=f(\lambda_{3}),\;...\]

\end_inset

Subtracting the first equation from the second and dividing by 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{p(\lambda_{1}+\varepsilon)-p(\lambda_{1})}{\varepsilon}=\frac{f(\lambda_{1}+\varepsilon)-f(\lambda_{1})}{\varepsilon}.\]

\end_inset

In the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 this becomes
\begin_inset Formula \[
p^{\prime}(\lambda_{1})=f^{\prime}(\lambda_{1}).\]

\end_inset

 Therefore, the polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $p(x)$
\end_inset

 is determined by the requirements that 
\emph on

\begin_inset Formula \[
p(\lambda_{1})=f(\lambda_{1}),\; p^{\prime}(\lambda_{1})=f^{\prime}(\lambda_{1}),\; p(\lambda_{3})=f(\lambda_{3}),\;...\]

\end_inset


\emph default
If 
\emph on
three
\emph default
 roots coincide, say 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=\lambda_{2}=\lambda_{3}$
\end_inset

, we introduce two auxiliary parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{3}$
\end_inset

 and first obtain the three equations
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
p(\lambda_{1}) & =f(\lambda_{1}),\; p(\lambda_{1}+\varepsilon_{2})=f(\lambda_{1}+\varepsilon_{2}),\\
 & p(\lambda_{1}+\varepsilon_{2}+\varepsilon_{3})=f(\lambda_{1}+\varepsilon_{2}+\varepsilon_{3}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Subtracting the equations and taking the limit 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{2}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

 as before, we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
p(\lambda_{1})=f(\lambda_{1}),\; p^{\prime}(\lambda_{1})=f^{\prime}(\lambda_{1}),\; p^{\prime}(\lambda_{1}+\varepsilon_{3})=f^{\prime}(\lambda_{1}+\varepsilon_{3}).\]

\end_inset

Subtracting now the second equation from the third and taking the limit
 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon_{3}\rightarrow0$
\end_inset

, we find 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{\prime\prime}(\lambda_{1})=f^{\prime\prime}(\lambda_{1})$

 the operator is diagonalizable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
* Square roots of operators
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the previous section we have seen that functions of operators can be
 sometimes computed explicitly.
 However, our methods work either for diagonalizable operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 or for functions 
\begin_inset Formula $f(x)$
\end_inset

 given by a power series that converges for every eigenvalue of the operator
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 If these conditions are not met, functions of operators may not exist or
 may not be uniquely defined.
 As an example where these problems arise, we will briefly consider the
 task of computing the square root of a given operator.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 we would like to define its square root as an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}^{2}=\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 For a diagonalizable operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{i}^{*}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is an eigenbasis and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{i}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the dual basis) we can easily find a suitable 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 by writing
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{B}\equiv\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sqrt{\lambda_{i}}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{i}^{*}.\]

\end_inset

 Note that the numeric square root 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\lambda_{i}}$
\end_inset

 has an ambiguous sign; so with each possible choice of sign for each 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\lambda_{i}}$
\end_inset

, we obtain a possible choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

.
 (Depending on the problem at hand, there might be a natural way of fixing
 the signs; for instance, if all 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 are positive then it might be useful to choose also all 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\lambda_{i}}$
\end_inset

 as positive.) The ambiguity of signs is expected; what is unexpected is
 that there could be many other operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 satisfying 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}^{2}=\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, as the following example shows.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

 We look for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}^{2}=\hat{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Straightforward solutions are 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}=\pm\hat{1}$
\end_inset

 However, consider the following operator,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{B}\equiv\left(\begin{array}{cc}

0 & a^{2}+bc\end{array}\right)=\left(a^{2}+bc\right)\hat{1}.\]

\end_inset

 This 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}^{2}=\hat{1}$

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c\in\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $a^{2}+bc=1$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}^{2}=\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is a given operator, and denote for brevity 
\begin_inset Formula $a\equiv\text{Tr}\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $b\equiv\text{Tr}\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is given but 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 is still unknown).
 In two dimensions, any operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 satisfies the characteristic equation
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{B}^{2}-(\text{Tr}\hat{B})\hat{B}+(\det\hat{B})\hat{1}=0.\]

\end_inset

Taking the trace of this equation, we can express the determinant as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\det\hat{B}=\frac{1}{2}(\text{Tr}\hat{B})^{2}-\frac{1}{2}\text{Tr}(\hat{B}^{2})\]

\end_inset

and hence 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
b\hat{B}=\hat{A}+\frac{b^{2}-a}{2}\hat{1}.\label{eq:B ans 2D}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This equation will yield an explicit formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 if we only determine the value of the constant 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $b\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Squaring the above equation and taking the trace, we find
\begin_inset Formula \[
b^{4}-2b^{2}a+c=0,\quad c\equiv2\text{Tr}(\hat{A}^{2})-a^{2}=a^{2}-4\det\hat{A}.\]

\end_inset

Hence, we obtain up to 
\emph on
four
\emph default
 possible solutions for 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
b=\pm\sqrt{a\pm\sqrt{a^{2}-c}}=\pm\sqrt{\text{Tr}\hat{A}\pm2\sqrt{\det\hat{A}}}.\label{eq:b equ}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Each value of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $b\neq0$
\end_inset

 yield possible operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 through Eq.\InsetSpace ~

 Denoting by 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{1}=\pm1$

\begin_inset Formula $s_{2}=\pm1$
\end_inset

 the two free choices of signs in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:b equ}

), we may write the general solution (assuming 
\begin_inset Formula $b\neq0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\hat{B}=s_{1}\frac{\hat{A}+s_{2}\sqrt{\det\hat{A}}\hat{1}}{\sqrt{\text{Tr}\hat{A}+2s_{2}\sqrt{\det\hat{A}}}}.\label{eq:B ans 2D new}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 It is straightforward to verify (using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

) that every such 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 indeed satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}^{2}=\hat{A}$

 Due to the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, any analytic function of

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$

 In that case, Eq.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 plus a multiple of

 must be equal to the zero operator.
 Note that Eq.\InsetSpace ~

 consequence of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}^{2}=\hat{A}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$

 exists.
 Hence, when 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

 (Note that this method can only yield solutions 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$

 that are linear combinations of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

 There are no other solutions except those shown in Example\InsetSpace ~

\begin_layout Standard
Let us summarize our results so far.
 In two dimensions, the general calculation of a square root of a given
 operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 proceeds as follows: If 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is proportional to the identity operator, we have various solutions of
 the form shown in Example\InsetSpace ~
1.
 (Not every one of these solutions may be relevant for the problem at hand,
 but they exist.) If 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is not proportional to the identity operator, we solve Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:b equ}

\end_inset

) and obtain up to four possible values of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

.
 If the only solution is 
\begin_inset Formula $b=0$
\end_inset

, the square root of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 does not exist.
 Otherwise, every 
\emph on
nonzero
\emph default
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 yields a solution 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 according to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:B ans 2D}

\end_inset

), and there are no other solutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example\InsetSpace ~

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We would like to determine a square root of the operator 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 3\\
0 & 4\end{array}\right).\]

\end_inset

We compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}=4$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a=\text{Tr}\hat{A}=5$
\end_inset

.
 Hence Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:b equ}

\end_inset

) gives four nonzero values, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
b=\pm\sqrt{5\pm4}=\left\{ \pm1,\pm3\right\} .\]

\end_inset

Substituting these values of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 into Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:B ans 2D}

\end_inset

) and solving for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{B}=\pm\left(\begin{array}{cc}

0 & 2\end{array}\right),\quad\hat{B}=\pm\left(\begin{array}{cc}
-1 & 3\\
0 & 2\end{array}\right).\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $b=0$
\end_inset

 is not a solution, while 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\neq\lambda\hat{1}$

 We will be looking for a formula expressing 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 as a polynomial in

 As we have seen, this will certainly not give

 The Cayley-Hamilton theorem for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 together with Exercise\InsetSpace ~
1 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{par:Trace relation1}

\end_inset

 (page\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \pageref{par:Trace relation1}

\end_inset

) yields a simplified equation,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align}
0 & =\hat{B}^{3}-b\hat{B}^{2}+s\hat{B}-(\det\hat{B})\hat{1}\nonumber \\
 & =(\hat{A}+s\hat{1})\hat{B}-b\hat{A}-(\det\hat{B})\hat{1},\label{eq:ABsb}\\

\end_inset

Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{B}=\pm\sqrt{\det\hat{A}}$
\end_inset

 and hence can be considered known.
 Moving 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 to another side in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:ABsb}

\end_inset

) and squaring the resulting equation, we find 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\hat{A}^{2}+2s\hat{A}+s^{2}\hat{1})\hat{A}=(b\hat{A}+(\det\hat{B})\hat{1})^{2}.\]

\end_inset

Expanding the brackets and using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 in the form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}^{3}-a\hat{A}^{2}+p\hat{A}-(\det\hat{A})\hat{1}=0,\]

\end_inset

where the coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
p=\frac{1}{2}(a^{2}-\text{Tr}(\hat{A}^{2})),\]

\end_inset

we obtain after simplifications
\begin_inset Formula \[
(s^{2}-p-2b\det\hat{B})\hat{A}=0.\]

\end_inset

This yields a fourth-order polynomial equation for 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\frac{b^{2}-a}{2}\right)^{2}-p-2b\det\hat{B}=0.\]

\end_inset

This equation can be solved, in principle.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 has up to 
\emph on
two
\emph default
 possible values, 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{B}=\pm\sqrt{\det\hat{A}}$
\end_inset

\emph on
up to eight

 possible values of 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 (and the corresponding values of 
\begin_inset Formula $s$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now we use a trick to express 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 We rewrite Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:ABsb}

\end_inset

) as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}\hat{B}=-s\hat{B}+b\hat{A}+(\det\hat{B})\hat{1}\]

\end_inset

and multiply both sides by 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

, substituting 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 back into the equation,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{A}^{2}+s\hat{A} & =b\hat{A}\hat{B}+(\det\hat{B})\hat{B}\\
 & =b[-s\hat{B}+b\hat{A}+(\det\hat{B})\hat{1}]+(\det\hat{B})\hat{B}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The last line yields 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{B}=\frac{1}{(\det\hat{B})-sb}[\hat{A}^{2}+(s-b^{2})\hat{A}-b(\det\hat{B})\hat{1}].\]

\end_inset

This is the final result, provided that the denominator 
\begin_inset Formula $(\det\hat{B}-sb)$
\end_inset

 does not vanish.
 In case this denominator vanishes, the present method cannot yield a formula
 for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$

 the eigenvalues, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{i}=\lambda_{i}\mathbf{e}_{i}$

 (The eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 are not necessarily all different.) Then we have 
\begin_inset Formula $(\hat{A})^{n}\mathbf{e}_{i}=\lambda_{i}^{n}\mathbf{e}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and therefore
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\exp\hat{A})\mathbf{e}_{i}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}(\hat{A})^{n}\mathbf{e}_{i}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n!}\lambda_{i}^{n}\mathbf{e}_{i}=e^{\lambda_{i}}\mathbf{e}_{i}.\]

\end_inset

The trace of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

\begin_inset Formula $\text{Tr}\hat{A}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\lambda_{i}$

 Hence we can easily verify the Liouville formula,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\det(\exp\hat{A})=e^{\lambda_{1}}...e^{\lambda_{N}}=\exp(\lambda_{1}+...+\lambda_{n})=\exp(\text{Tr}\hat{A}).\]

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If

\end_inset

 is an oper\SpecialChar \-
ator-valued formal power series such that the inverse 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{-1}(t)$
\end_inset

\end_inset

If the inverse does not exist, we need to replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}\cdot\hat{A}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 in Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:pre Liouville 1}

\end_inset

) by the algebraic complement, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\hat{A}}\equiv\big({\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-1}}\big)^{\wedge T}\]

\end_inset

 (see Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-algebraic-complement}

\end_inset

), so that we obtain the formula of Jacobi,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\partial_{t}\det\hat{A}=\text{Tr}\,[\tilde{\hat{A}}\,\partial_{t}\hat{A}].\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof of Lemma\InsetSpace ~
4:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A straightforward calculation using Lemma\InsetSpace ~
2 gives
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\big(\partial_{t}\det\hat{A}(t)\big)\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge... & \wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}=\partial_{t}[\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N}]\\
 & =\sum_{k=1}^{N}\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge(\partial_{t}\hat{A})\mathbf{v}_{k}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Now we use the definition of the algebraic complement operator to rewrite
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge(\partial_{t}\hat{A})\mathbf{v}_{k}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N}=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge(\tilde{\hat{A}}\,\partial_{t}\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{k})\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

Hence
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
(\partial_{t}\det\hat{A})\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N} & =\sum_{k=1}^{N}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge(\tilde{\hat{A}}\,\partial_{t}\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{k})\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\\
 & =\wedge^{N}(\tilde{\hat{A}}\,\partial_{t}\hat{A})^{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\\
 & =\text{Tr}\,[\tilde{\hat{A}}\,\partial_{t}\hat{A}]\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}\det\hat{A}=\text{Tr}\,[\tilde{\hat{A}}\,\partial_{t}\hat{A}]$
\end_inset

.
 When 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{-1}$
\end_inset

 exists, we may express 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\hat{A}}$
\end_inset

 through the inverse matrix, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\hat{A}}=(\det\hat{A})\hat{A}^{-1}$
\end_inset

, and obtain Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:pre Liouville 1}

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof of Theorem 1:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It follows from Lemma\InsetSpace ~
3 that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{F}^{-1}(t)$
\end_inset

 exists since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{F}(0)=\hat{1}$
\end_inset

, and it follows from Lemma\InsetSpace ~
4 that the oper\SpecialChar \-
ator-valued function 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{F}(t)=\exp(t\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 satisfies the differential equation
\begin_inset Formula \[
\partial_{t}\det\hat{F}(t)=\det\hat{F}(t)\cdot\textrm{Tr}[\hat{F}^{-1}\partial_{t}\hat{F}].\]

\end_inset

From Lemma\InsetSpace ~
1, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{F}^{-1}\partial_{t}\hat{F}=\hat{F}^{-1}\hat{F}\hat{A}=\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, therefore
\begin_inset Formula \[
\partial_{t}\det\hat{F}(t)=\det\hat{F}(t)\cdot\textrm{Tr}\hat{A}.\]

\end_inset

This is a differential equation for the number-valued formal power series
 
\begin_inset Formula $f(t)\equiv\det\hat{F}(t)$
\end_inset

, with the initial condition 
\begin_inset Formula $f(0)=1$
\end_inset

.
 The solution (which we may still regard as a formal power series) is
\begin_inset Formula \[
f(t)=\exp(t\textrm{Tr}\hat{A}).\]

\end_inset

Therefore
\begin_inset Formula \[
\det\hat{F}(t)\equiv\det\exp(t\hat{A})=\exp(t\textrm{Tr}\hat{A}).\]

 is expressed (for 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq k\leq N-1$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula \[
\partial_{t}q_{k}=\text{Tr}\,\big[(\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-k-1})^{\wedge T}\partial_{t}\hat{A}\big].\]

\end_inset

Note that the first operator in the brackets is the one we denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{(k+1)}$
\end_inset

 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Properties-of-the-algebraic-complement}

\end_inset

, so we can write
\begin_inset Formula \[
\partial_{t}q_{k}=\text{Tr}\,[\hat{A}_{(k+1)}\partial_{t}\hat{A}].\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We apply the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-k})$
\end_inset

 to the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\equiv\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis.
 We assume that the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 do not depend on 
\begin_inset Formula $t$
\end_inset

, so we can compute 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\big[\partial_{t}(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-k})\big]\omega=\partial_{t}\big[{\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-k}}\omega\big].\]

\end_inset

 The result is a sum of terms such as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N-k-1}\wedge\partial_{t}\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N-k}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N-k+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\]

\end_inset

and other terms obtained by permuting the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 (without introducing any minus signs!).
 The total number of these terms is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $N{N-1 \choose N-k-1}$
\end_inset

, since we need to choose a single vector to which 
\begin_inset Formula $\partial_{t}\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 will apply, and then 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(N-k-1\right)$
\end_inset

 vectors to which 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 will apply, among the 
\begin_inset Formula $(N-1)$
\end_inset

 remaining vectors.
 Now consider the expression
\begin_inset Formula \[
\text{Tr}\,\big[(\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-k-1})^{\wedge T}\partial_{t}\hat{A}\big]\omega.\]

\end_inset

This expression is the sum of terms such as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}_{(k+1)}\partial_{t}\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\]

\end_inset

and other terms with permuted vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 There will be 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 such terms, since we choose one vector out of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 to apply the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{(k+1)}\partial_{t}\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Using the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{(k+1)}$
\end_inset

, we write
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \hat{A}_{(k+1)}\partial_{t}\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}\\
 & \;=\partial_{t}\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\big[{\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-k-1}}\big](\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N})\\
 & \;=\partial_{t}\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{N-k}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N-k+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}+...,\end{align*}

\end_inset

where in the last line we omitted all other permutations of the vectors.
 (There will be 
\begin_inset Formula ${N-1 \choose N-k-1}$
\end_inset

 such permutations.) It follows that the tensor expressions 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\partial_{t}q_{k}\omega\equiv\partial_{t}(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-k})\omega\]

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Tr}\,[\hat{A}_{(k+1)}\partial_{t}\hat{A}]\omega$
\end_inset

 consist of the same terms; thus they are equal,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\partial_{t}q_{k}\omega=\text{Tr}\,[\hat{A}_{(k+1)}\partial_{t}\hat{A}]\omega.\]

\end_inset

Since this holds for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega\in\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

, we obtain the required statement.

 Since (by assumption)

Statement:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We denote for brevity 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}\equiv\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}\equiv\text{Tr}(\hat{A}^{k})$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,2,...$
\end_inset

, and set 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}\equiv0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k>N$
\end_inset

.
 Then all 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}$
\end_inset

 can be expressed as polynomials in 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}$
\end_inset

, and these polynomials are equal to the coefficients at 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{k}$
\end_inset

 of the formal power series
\begin_inset Formula \[
G(x)=\exp\left[t_{1}x-t_{2}\frac{x^{2}}{2}+...+\left(-1\right)^{n-1}t_{n}\frac{x^{n}}{n}+...\right]\equiv\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}x^{k}q_{k}\]

\end_inset

by collecting the powers of the formal variable 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 up to the desired order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\det(\hat{1}+x\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 as a formal power series in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

.
 By the Liouville formula, we have the following identity of formal power
 series,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\ln\det(\hat{1}+x\hat{A}) & =\text{Tr}\left[\ln(\hat{1}+x\hat{A})\right]\\
 & =\text{Tr}\left[x\hat{A}-\frac{x^{2}}{2}\hat{A}^{2}+...+\left(-1\right)^{n-1}\frac{x^{n}}{n}\hat{A}^{n}+...\right]\\
 & =xt_{1}-\frac{x^{2}}{2}t_{2}+...+\left(-1\right)^{n-1}t_{n}\frac{x^{n}}{n}+...,\end{align*}

\end_inset

where we substituted the power series for the logarithm function and used
 the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{k}\equiv\text{Tr}(\hat{A}^{k})$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, we have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\det(\hat{1}+x\hat{A})=\exp G(x)\]

\end_inset

as the identity of  formal power series.
 On the other hand, 
\begin_inset Formula $\det(\hat{1}+x\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 is actually a 
\emph on
polynomial
\emph default
 of degree 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
a formal power series that has all zero coefficients from 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{N+1}$
\end_inset

 onwards.
 The coefficients of this polynomial are found by using 
\begin_inset Formula $x\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 in Lemma\InsetSpace ~
1 of Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-characteristic-polynomial}

\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\det(\hat{1}+x\hat{A})=1+q_{1}x+...+q_{N}x^{N}.\]

\end_inset

Therefore, the coefficient at 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{k}$
\end_inset

 in the formal power series 
\begin_inset Formula $\exp G(x)$
\end_inset

 is indeed equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,...,N$
\end_inset

.
 (The coefficients at 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{k}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k>N$
\end_inset

 are all zero!)

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Expanding the given series up to terms of order 
\begin_inset Formula $x^{4}$
\end_inset

, we find after some straightforward calculations
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
G(x) & =t_{1}x+\frac{t_{1}^{2}-t_{2}}{2}x^{2}+\left[\frac{t_{1}^{3}}{6}-\frac{t_{1}t_{2}}{2}+\frac{t_{3}}{3}\right]x^{3}\\
 & +\left[\frac{t_{1}^{4}}{24}-\frac{t_{1}^{2}t_{2}}{4}+\frac{t_{2}^{2}}{8}+\frac{t_{1}t_{3}}{3}-\frac{t_{4}}{4}\right]x^{4}+O(x^{5}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Replacing 
\begin_inset Formula $t_{j}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Tr}(\hat{A}^{j})$
\end_inset

 and collecting the terms at the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-th power of 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

, we obtain the 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-th trace relation.
 For example, the trace relation for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=4$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{4} & =\frac{1}{24}(\text{Tr}\hat{A})^{4}-\frac{1}{4}\text{Tr}(\hat{A}^{2})(\text{Tr}\hat{A})^{2}+\frac{1}{8}\left[\text{Tr}(\hat{A}^{2})\right]^{2}\\
 & +\frac{1}{3}\text{Tr}(\hat{A}^{3})\text{Tr}\hat{A}-\frac{1}{4}\text{Tr}(\hat{A}^{4}).\end{align*}

\end_inset

Note that this formula is valid for all 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, even for 
\begin_inset Formula $N<4$
\end_inset

; in the latter case, 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{4}=0$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-characteristic-polynomial}

\end_inset

 that the eigenvalues of a linear operator are the roots of the characteristic
 polynomial, and that there exists 
\emph on
at least one
\emph default
 eigenvector corresponding to each eigenvalue.
 In this section we will assume that the total number of roots of the characteri
stic polynomial, counting the algebraic multiplicity, is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 (the dimension of the space).
 This is the case, for instance, when the field 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 is that of the complex numbers (
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

); otherwise not all polynomials will have roots belonging to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dimension of the eigenspace corresponding to an eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 (the 
\series bold
geometric multiplicity
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{geometric multiplicity}

\end_inset

) is not larger than the algebraic multiplicity of the root 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 in the characteristic polynomial (Theorem\InsetSpace ~
1 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-characteristic-polynomial}

\end_inset

).
 The geometric multiplicity is in any case not less than 1 because at least
 one eigenvector exists (Theorem\InsetSpace ~
2 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Existence-of-solutions}

\end_inset

).
 However, it may happen that the algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue
 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is larger than 1 but the geometric multiplicity is strictly smaller than
 the algebraic multiplicity.
 For example, an operator given in some basis by the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
0 & 0\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

has only one eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

 of algebraic multiplicity 2.
 Note that this has nothing to do with missing real roots of algebraic equations
; this operator has only one eigenvector even if we allow complex eigenvectors.
 In this case, the operator is not diagonalizable because there are insufficient
ly many eigenvectors to build a basis.
 The theory of the Jordan canonical form explains the structure of the operator
 in this case and finds a suitable basis that contains all the eigenvectors
 and also some additional vectors (called the 
\series bold
root
\series default
 
\series bold
vectors
\series default
), such that the given operator has a particularly simple form when expressed
 through that basis.
 This form is block-diag\SpecialChar \-
onal and consists of 
\series bold

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Jordan cell}

, which are square matrices such as
\begin_inset Formula \[

0 & \lambda & 1\\
0 & 0 & \lambda\end{array}\right),\]

\end_inset

and similarly built matrices of higher dimension.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To perform the required analysis, it is convenient to consider each eigenvalue
 of a given operator separately and build the required basis gradually.
 Since the procedure is somewhat long, we will organize it by steps.
 The result of the procedure will be a construction of a basis (the 
\series bold
Jordan basis

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Jordan basis}

\end_inset

) in which the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 has the Jordan canonical form.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Step 0: Set up the initial basis.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\in\text{End}\, V$
\end_inset

 be a linear operator having the eigenvalues 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

,...,
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{n}$
\end_inset

, and let us consider the first eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

; suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

 has algebraic multiplicity 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 If the geometric multiplicity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

 is also equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, we can choose a linearly independent set of 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 basis eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{m}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and continue to work with the next eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 If the geometric multiplicity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

 is less than 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, we can only choose a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $r<m$
\end_inset

 basis eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{r}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In either case, we have found a set of eigenvectors with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

 that spans the entire eigenspace.
 We can repeat Step\InsetSpace ~
0 for every eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 and obtain the spanning sets of eigenvectors.
 The resulting set of eigenvectors can be completed to a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 At the end of Step\InsetSpace ~
0, we have a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{k},\mathbf{u}_{k+1},...,\mathbf{u}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

, where the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 are eigenvectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 and the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

 are chosen arbitrarily --- as long as the result is a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 By construction, any eigenvector of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

's.
 If the eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 are sufficiently numerous as to make a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 without any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

's, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is diagonalizable and its Jordan basis is the eigenbasis; the procedure
 is finished.
 We need to proceed with the next steps only in the case when the eigenvectors
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 do not yet span the entire space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, so the Jordan basis is not yet determined.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Step 1: Determine a root vector.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will now concentrate on an eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

 for which the geometric multiplicity 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 is less than the algebraic multiplicity 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 At the previous step, we have found a basis containing all the eigenvectors
 needed to span every eigenspace.
 The basis presently has the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{r},\mathbf{u}_{r+1},...,\mathbf{u}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{i}\,|\,1\leq i\leq r\right\} $
\end_inset

 span the eigenspace of the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{i}\,|\, r+1\leq i\leq N\right\} $
\end_inset

 are either eigenvectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to other eigenvalues, or other basis vectors.
 Without loss of generality, we may assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 (otherwise we need to consider temporarily the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}-\lambda_{1}\hat{1}_{V}$
\end_inset

, which has all the same eigenvectors as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

).
 Since the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 has eigenvalue 0 with algebraic multiplicity 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

, the characteristic polynomial has the form 
\begin_inset Formula $Q_{\hat{A}}(\lambda)=\lambda^{m}\tilde{q}(\lambda)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{q}(\lambda)$
\end_inset

 is some other polynomial.
 Since the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial are proportional
 to the operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{k}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq k\leq N$
\end_inset

, we find that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-m}\neq0,\;\text{while}\;\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-k}=0,\quad0\leq k<m.\]

\end_inset

In other words, we have found that several operators of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-k}$
\end_inset

 vanish.
 Let us now try to obtain some information about the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

 by considering the action of these operators on the 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

-vector 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\omega\equiv\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{r}\wedge\mathbf{u}_{r+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

The result must be zero; for instance, we have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N})\omega=\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...=0\]

\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}=0$
\end_inset

.
 We do not obtain any new information by considering the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}$
\end_inset

 because the application of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 acts with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

, which immediately yields zero.
 A nontrivial result can be obtained only if we do not act with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 on 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 of the 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, we turn to considering the operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-k}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $k\geq r$
\end_inset

; these operators involve sufficiently few powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-k}\omega$
\end_inset

 may avoid containing any terms 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first such operator is
\begin_inset Formula \[
0{\lyxbuildrel!\above=}(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-r})\omega=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{r}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{u}_{r+1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{u}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

It follows that the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{r},\hat{A}\mathbf{u}_{r+1},...,\hat{A}\mathbf{u}_{N}\}$
\end_inset

 is linearly dependent, so there exists a vanishing linear combination
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{r}c_{i}\mathbf{v}_{i}+\sum_{i=r+1}^{N}c_{i}\hat{A}\mathbf{u}_{i}=0\label{eq:vanishing linear combination}\end{equation}

\end_inset

with at least some 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Let us define the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\equiv\sum_{i=1}^{r}c_{i}\mathbf{v}_{i},\quad\mathbf{x}\equiv-\sum_{i=r+1}^{N}c_{i}\mathbf{u}_{i},\]

\end_inset

so that Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:vanishing linear combination}

\end_inset

) is rewritten as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}=\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\neq0$
\end_inset

, for otherwise we would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{i=1}^{r}c_{i}\mathbf{v}_{i}=0$
\end_inset

, which contradicts the linear independence of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{r}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Further, the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 cannot be equal to zero, for otherwise we would have 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}=0$
\end_inset

, so there would exist an additional eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\neq0$
\end_inset

 that is not a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

, which is impossible since (by assumption) the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{r}\right\} $
\end_inset

 spans the entire subspace of all eigenvectors with eigenvalue 0.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\neq0$
\end_inset

, so at least one of the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ c_{i}\,|\,1\leq i\leq r\right\} $
\end_inset

 is nonzero.
 Without loss of generality, we assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Then we can replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 in the basis; the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{\mathbf{v}},\mathbf{v}_{2},...,\mathbf{v}_{r},\mathbf{u}_{r+1},...,\mathbf{u}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is still a basis because
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{r} & =(c_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}+...)\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{r}\\
 & =c_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{r}\neq0.\end{align*}

\end_inset

 Similarly, at least one of the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ c_{i}\,|\, r+1\leq i\leq N\right\} $
\end_inset

 is nonzero.
 We would like to replace one of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

's in the basis by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

; it is possible to replace 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 as long as 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 However, we do not wish to remove from the basis any of the eigenvectors
 corresponding to other eigenvalues; so we need to choose the index 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is not one of the other eigenvectors and at the same time 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 This choice is possible; for were it impossible, the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 were a linear combination of other eigenvectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 (all having nonzero eigenvalues), so 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is again a linear combination of those eigenvectors, which contradicts
 the equations 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}=\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\tilde{\mathbf{v}}=0$
\end_inset

 because 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 is linearly independent of all other eigenvectors.
 Therefore, we can choose a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

 that is not an eigenvector and such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 can be replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Without loss of generality, we may assume that this vector is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{r+1}$
\end_inset

.
 The new basis, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{\mathbf{v}},\mathbf{v}_{2},...,\mathbf{v}_{r},\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}_{r+2},...,\mathbf{u}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is still linearly independent because
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\omega}\equiv\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{r}\wedge\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{u}_{r+2}...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{N}\neq0\]

\end_inset

due to 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{r+1}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Renaming now 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\rightarrow\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{x}_{1}$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\omega}\rightarrow\omega$
\end_inset

, we obtain a new basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{r},\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{u}_{r+2},...,\mathbf{u}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 are eigenvectors (
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{i}=0$
\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}_{1}=\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 Eventually the Jordan basis

\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-k}$
\end_inset

 that vanish, and we cannot extract any more information.
 Otherwise 
\begin_inset Formula $r+1<m$
\end_inset

, and we will continue by considering the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-r-1}$
\end_inset

, which vanishes as well:
\begin_inset Formula \[
0=(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-r-1})\omega=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{r}\wedge\mathbf{x}_{1}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{u}_{r+2}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{u}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

(Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{x}_{1}=0$
\end_inset

, so in writing 
\begin_inset Formula $(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-r-1})\omega$
\end_inset

 we omit the terms where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 acts on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 or on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and write only the term where the operators 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 act on the 
\begin_inset Formula $N-r-1$
\end_inset

 vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

.) As before, it follows that there exists a vanishing linear combination
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^{r}c_{i}\mathbf{v}_{i}+c_{r+1}\mathbf{x}_{1}+\sum_{i=r+2}^{N}c_{i}\hat{A}\mathbf{u}_{i}=0.\label{eq:combination 2}\end{equation}

\end_inset

We introduce the auxiliary vectors 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\equiv\sum_{i=1}^{r}c_{i}\mathbf{v}_{i},\quad\mathbf{x}\equiv-\sum_{i=r+2}^{N}c_{i}\mathbf{u}_{i},\]

\end_inset

and rewrite Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:combination 2}

\end_inset

) as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\hat{A}\mathbf{x}=c_{r+1}\mathbf{x}_{1}+\tilde{\mathbf{v}}.\label{eq:A tilde x v}\end{equation}

\end_inset

 As before, we find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 There are now two possibilities: either 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{r+1}=0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{r+1}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{r+1}=0$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is another root vector of order 1.
 As before, we show that one of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 (but not 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

) may be replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

, and one of the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

 (but not one of the other eigenvectors or root vectors) may be replaced
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 After renaming the vectors (
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}\rightarrow\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{x}_{2}$
\end_inset

), the result is a new basis
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{r},\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{x}_{2},\mathbf{u}_{r+3},...,\mathbf{u}_{N}\right\} ,\label{eq:Jordan basis 0}\end{equation}

\end_inset

such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}_{1}=\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}_{2}=\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 It is important to keep the information that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{2}$
\end_inset

 are root vectors of order 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The other possibility is that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{r+1}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Without loss of generality, we may assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{r+1}=1$
\end_inset

 (otherwise we divide Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:A tilde x v}

\end_inset

) by 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{r+1}$
\end_inset

 and redefine 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

).
 In this case 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is a root vector of order 2; according to Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:A tilde x v}

\end_inset

), acting with 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 yields a root vector of order 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 and a linear combination of some eigenvectors.
 We will modify the basis again in order to simplify the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

; namely, we redefine 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{1}\equiv\mathbf{x}_{1}+\tilde{\mathbf{v}}$
\end_inset

 so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}=\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 The new vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is still a root vector of order 1 because it satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{1}=\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

, and the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{1}$
\end_inset

 in the basis may be replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 As before, one of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

's can be replaced by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 Renaming 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{1}\rightarrow\mathbf{x}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\rightarrow\mathbf{x}_{2}$
\end_inset

, we obtain the basis
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{r},\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{x}_{2},\mathbf{u}_{r+3},...,\mathbf{u}_{N}\right\} ,\]

\end_inset

 where now we record that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{2}$
\end_inset

 is a root vector of order 2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The procedure of determining the root vectors can be continued in this fashion
 until all the root vectors corresponding to the eigenvalue 0 are found.
 The end result will be a basis of the form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{r},\mathbf{x}_{1},...,\mathbf{x}_{m-r},\mathbf{u}_{m+1},...,\mathbf{u}_{N}\right\} ,\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{v}_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 are eigenvectors, 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{x}_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 are root vectors of various orders, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{u}_{i}\}$
\end_inset

 are the vectors that do not belong to this eigenvalue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Generally, a root vector of order 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 for the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}=0$
\end_inset

 is a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $(\hat{A})^{k}\mathbf{x}=0$
\end_inset

.
 However, we have constructed the root vectors such that they come in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

chains,
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for example 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}_{2}=\mathbf{x}_{1}$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}_{1}=\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Clearly, this is the simplest possible arrangement of basis vectors.
 There are at most 
\begin_inset Formula $r$
\end_inset

 chains for a given eigenvalue because each eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,r$
\end_inset

) may have an associated chain of root vectors.
 Note that the root chains for an eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\neq0$
\end_inset

 have the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}=\lambda\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}_{1}=\lambda\mathbf{x}_{1}+\mathbf{v}_{1}$

The characteristic polynomial of

 Instead, it suffices to consider the derivative

 and to note that

 that we need to remove from

 Therefore, one computes the greatest common divisor of

An operator

 if and only if 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\hat{A})=0$

\begin_inset Formula $p(\lambda)$

 is the square-free reduction of the characteristic polynomial

Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Jordan canonical form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 may contain several Jordan cells corresponding to different eigenvalues.
 Suppose that the set of the eigenvalues of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \lambda_{i}\,|\, i=1,...,n\right\} $
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{i}$
\end_inset

 are all different and have algebraic multiplicities 
\begin_inset Formula $s_{i}$
\end_inset

; then the characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula \[
Q_{\hat{A}}(x)=\left(\lambda_{1}-x\right)^{s_{1}}...\left(\lambda_{n}-x\right)^{s_{n}},\]

\end_inset

and its square-free reduction is the polynomial
\begin_inset Formula \[
p(x)=\left(\lambda_{1}-x\right)...\left(\lambda_{n}-x\right).\]

\end_inset

If the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is diagonalizable, its eigenvectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\,|\, j=1,...,N\right\} $
\end_inset

 are a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\hat{A})\mathbf{v}_{j}=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,N$
\end_inset

.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\hat{A})=\hat{0}$
\end_inset

 as an operator.
 If the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is not diagonalizable, there exists at least one nontrivial Jordan cell
 with root vectors.
 Without loss of generality, let us assume that this Jordan cell corresponds
 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Then there exists a root vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{x}=\lambda_{1}\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{1}=\lambda_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Then we can compute 
\begin_inset Formula $(\lambda_{1}-\hat{A})\mathbf{x}=-\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
p(\hat{A})\mathbf{x} & =(\lambda_{1}-\hat{A})...(\lambda_{n}-\hat{A})\mathbf{x}\\
 & \,{\lyxbuildrel(1)\above=}\,(\lambda_{n}-\hat{A})...(\lambda_{2}-\hat{A})(\lambda_{1}-\hat{A})\mathbf{x}\\
 & \,{\lyxbuildrel(2)\above=}\,-\left(\lambda_{n}-\lambda_{1}\right)...\left(\lambda_{2}-\lambda_{1}\right)\mathbf{v}_{1}\neq0,\end{align*}

\end_inset

where in 
\begin_inset Formula ${\lyxbuildrel(1)\above=}$
\end_inset

 we used the fact that operators 
\begin_inset Formula $(\lambda_{i}-\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 all commute with each other, and in 
\begin_inset Formula ${\lyxbuildrel(2)\above=}$
\end_inset

 we used the property of an eigenvector, 
\begin_inset Formula $q(\hat{A})\mathbf{v}_{1}=q(\lambda_{1})\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

 for any polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $q(x)$
\end_inset

.
 Thus we have shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 gives a nonzero vector on 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, which means that 
\begin_inset Formula $p(\hat{A})$
\end_inset

 is a nonzero operator.

 The statement that

 then it is also an eigenvector of

 If

 Similarly, one can show that the root chains of

\begin_layout Section
* Construction of projectors onto Jordan cells
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now consider the problem of determining the Jordan cells.
 It turns out that we can write a general expression for a projector onto
 a single Jordan cell of an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 The projector is expressed as a polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 with known coefficients.
 (Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 may or may not be diagonalizable.) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The required projector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}$
\end_inset

 can be viewed as an operator that has the same Jordan cells as 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 but the eigenvalues are 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 for a single chosen Jordan cell and 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 for all other Jordan cells.
 One way to construct the projector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}$
\end_inset

 is to look for a polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 such that the eigenvalues and the Jordan cells are mapped as desired.
 Some examples of this were discussed at the end of the previous subsection;
 however, the construction required a complete knowledge of the Jordan canonical
 form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 with all eigenvectors and root vectors.
 We will consider a different method of computing the projector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}$
\end_inset

.
 With this method, we only need to know the characteristic polynomial of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, a single eigenvalue, and the 
\emph on
algebraic
\emph default
 multiplicity of the chosen eigenvalue.
 We will develop this method beginning with the simplest case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement 1:

\begin_layout Standard
If the characteristic polynomial 
\begin_inset Formula $Q\left(\lambda\right)$

\end_inset

 has a zero

\end_inset

 of multiplicity 1, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
if 
\begin_inset Formula $Q(\lambda_{0})=0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q'(\lambda_{0})\neq0$
\end_inset

, then the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}_{\lambda_{0}}$
\end_inset

 defined by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{P}_{\lambda_{0}}\equiv-\frac{1}{Q^{\prime}(\lambda_{0})}{\big[{\wedge^{N-1}(\hat{A}-\lambda_{0}\hat{1}_{V})^{N-1}}\big]}^{\wedge T}\]

\end_inset

 onto the one-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}$

 The prefactor can be computed also as 
\begin_inset Formula $-Q^{\prime}(\lambda_{0})=\wedge^{N}(\hat{A}-\lambda_{0}\hat{1}_{V})^{N-1}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We denote 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}\equiv\hat{P}_{\lambda_{0}}$
\end_inset

 for brevity.
 We will first show that for any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

, the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is an eigenvector of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
that the image of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}$
\end_inset

 is a subspace of the 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}$
\end_inset

-eigenspace.
 Then it will be sufficient to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}\mathbf{v}_{0}=\mathbf{v}_{0}$
\end_inset

 for an eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{0}$
\end_inset

; it will follow that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}\hat{P}=\hat{P}$
\end_inset

 and so it will be proved that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}$
\end_inset

 is a projector onto the eigenspace.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Without loss of generality, we may set 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 (or else we consider the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}-\lambda_{0}\hat{1}_{V}$
\end_inset

 instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

).
 Then we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}=0$
\end_inset

, while the number 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-1}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the last-but-one coefficient in the characteristic polynomial,
 which is the same as 
\begin_inset Formula $-Q^{\prime}(\lambda_{0})$
\end_inset

 and is nonzero.
 Thus we set
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{P}=\frac{1}{\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-1}}\big({\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-1}}\big)^{\wedge T}=\frac{1}{\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-1}}\tilde{\hat{A}}\]

\end_inset

and note that by Lemma\InsetSpace ~
1 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-algebraic-complement}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{P}\hat{A}=\frac{1}{\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-1}}(\det\hat{A})\hat{1}_{V}=\hat{0}_{V}.\]

\end_inset

Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}$
\end_inset

 is a polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}\hat{A}=\hat{A}\hat{P}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}(\hat{P}\mathbf{x})=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in V$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{im}\hat{P}$
\end_inset

 is indeed a subspace of the eigenspace of the eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}=0$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}\mathbf{v}_{0}=\mathbf{v}_{0}$
\end_inset

 for an eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{0}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{0}=0$
\end_inset

.
 This is verified by a calculation: We use Lemma\InsetSpace ~
1 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~
\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:The-algebraic-complement}

\end_inset

, which is the identity
\begin_inset Formula \[
\big({\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-n}}\big)^{\wedge T}\hat{A}+\big({\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-n+1}}\big)^{\wedge T}=(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-n+1})\hat{1}_{V}\]

\end_inset

valid for all 
\begin_inset Formula $n=1$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, and apply both sides to the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{0}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $n=2$
\end_inset

:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\big({\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-2}}\big)^{\wedge T}\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{0}+\big({\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-1}}\big)^{\wedge T}\mathbf{v}_{0}=(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-1})\mathbf{v}_{0},\]

\end_inset

which yields the required formula, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\big({\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-1}}\big)^{\wedge T}\mathbf{v}_{0}}{\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-1}}=\mathbf{v}_{0},\]

\end_inset

since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{0}=0$
\end_inset

.

\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\hat{A}}\mathbf{v}_{0}$

 in this basis,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\tilde{\hat{A}}\mathbf{v}_{0}=c_{0}\mathbf{v}_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}c_{i}\mathbf{e}_{i}.\]

\end_inset

 The coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}$

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N-1}\wedge c_{0}\mathbf{v}_{0} & =\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N-1}\wedge\tilde{\hat{A}}\mathbf{v}_{0}\\

 acting on the basis tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N-1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{0}$

 produces only one nonzero term, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{N-1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{0}$

 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{0}=\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-1}$

\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

In our case,

 The basis in

\begin_inset Formula $\underbar{x}$

\emph on

 We first determine the characteristic polynomial,
\begin_inset Formula \[
Q_{\hat{A}}(\lambda)=\det(\hat{A}-\lambda\hat{1})=\frac{(\hat{A}-\lambda)\underbar{1}\wedge(\hat{A}-\lambda)\underbar{x}}{\underbar{1}\wedge\underbar{x}}=-\lambda(1-\lambda).\]

\end_inset

Let us determine the projector onto the eigenspace of

\begin_layout Standard
We first need to show that

 Since by assumption 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}$

\begin_inset Formula $n$

\begin_inset Formula $p(\lambda)$

\begin_inset Formula $p(\lambda_{0})\neq0$
\end_inset

 Without loss of generality we set 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}=0$

 With 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}=0$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\left(-\lambda^{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 in the characteristic polynomial means that many of its coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{k}\equiv\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N-k}$

We can rewrite this as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\hat{A}_{(k)}\hat{A}+\hat{A}_{(k-1)}=q_{k-1}\hat{1},\label{eq:A identity}\end{equation}

\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}_{(n)}\hat{A}=q_{n}\hat{P}^{(n)}\hat{A}=0.\]

 Acting with the operator

\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-n+1}(\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{n}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{n+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N})=0\]

\end_inset

 since at least one operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

 must act on some

 Therefore
\begin_inset Formula \[

\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
c_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N} & =\hat{P}\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}\\

 All other coefficients

\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-n+1}(\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{n}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{n+1}\wedge...\mathbf{e}_{N})=0\]

\end_inset

 since at least one operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 must act on some 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

, which yields zero within the exterior product.
 (By construction, either 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{i}=0$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{v}_{i}=\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $i\neq j$
\end_inset

.) Therefore
\begin_inset Formula \[
\big({\wedge^{N-1}\hat{A}^{N-n}}\big)^{\wedge T}\hat{A}=0\]

\end_inset

as in the proof of Statement\InsetSpace ~

 It follows that the image of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}$
\end_inset

 is within the Jordan cell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, a calculation quite similar to that in the proof of Statement\InsetSpace ~

 shows that every vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 (whether it is an eigenvector or a root vector of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

) is an eigenvector of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}$
\end_inset

 with eigenvalue 1.
 I leave the details as an exercise.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 starting with 
\begin_inset Formula $k=N$
\end_inset

: we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{(N)}=0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{(N-1)}=q_{N-1}\hat{1}-\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, and finally
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\hat{A}_{(k)}=q_{k}\hat{1}-q_{k+1}\hat{A}+...+q_{N}{(-\hat{A})}^{N-k}=\sum_{i=0}^{N-k}q_{k+i}(-\hat{A})^{i},\quad k\geq1.\label{eq:Ak explicit}\end{equation}

\end_inset

The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}_{\lambda_{0}}$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}_{(k)}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq k\leq n$
\end_inset

.
 The Jordan cell of dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 consists of all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in V$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{n}\mathbf{x}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, while computing 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}_{\lambda_{0}}\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{n}\mathbf{x}=0$
\end_inset

, we can restrict the summation over 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $0\leq i\leq n-1$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{P}_{\lambda_{0}}\mathbf{x}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}c_{k}\sum_{i=0}^{N-k}q_{k+i}(-\hat{A})^{i}\mathbf{x}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}c_{k}q_{k+i}(-\hat{A})^{i}\mathbf{x}.\]

\end_inset

We would like to choose the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset

 such that the sum above contains only the term 
\begin_inset Formula $(-\hat{A})^{0}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 with coefficient 1, while all other powers of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 will enter with zero coefficient.
 In other words, we require that
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\sum_{k=1}^{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}c_{k}q_{k+i}(-\hat{A})^{i}=\hat{1}\label{eq:ck condition}\end{equation}

\end_inset

identically as polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 This will happen if the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset

 satisfy 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^{n}c_{k}q_{k} & =1,\\
\sum_{k=1}^{n}c_{k}q_{k+i} & =0,\quad i=1,...,n-1.\end{align*}

\end_inset

This system of equations for the unknown coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset

 can be rewritten in matrix form as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{ccccc}
q_{n} & q_{n+1} & q_{n+2} & \cdots & q_{2n-1}\\
q_{n-1} & q_{n} & q_{n+1} & \cdots & q_{2n-2}\\
\vdots & q_{n-1} & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots\\
q_{2} & \vdots & \ddots & q_{n} & q_{n+1}\\
q_{1} & q_{2} & \cdots & q_{n-1} & q_{n}\end{array}\right)\left[\begin{array}{c}
c_{1}\\
c_{2}\\
\vdots\\
c_{n-1}\\
c_{n}\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
0_{\,}\\
0_{\,}\\
\vdots\\
0_{\,}\\
1_{\,}\end{array}\right].\]

\end_inset

However, it is given that 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda_{0}=0$
\end_inset

 is a root of multiplicity 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{0}=...=q_{n-1}=0$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the system of equations has the triangular form as given in
 Statement\InsetSpace ~
3.
 Its solution is unique since 
\begin_inset Formula $q_{n}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, we are able to choose 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{k}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}_{\lambda_{0}}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 within the Jordan cell.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}_{\lambda_{0}}$
\end_inset

 can be simplified by writing
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{P}_{\lambda_{0}}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\left[\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}c_{k}q_{k+i}(-\hat{A})^{i}+\sum_{i=n}^{N-k}c_{k}q_{k+i}(-\hat{A})^{i}\right].\]

\end_inset

The first sum yields 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{1}$
\end_inset

 by Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:ck condition}

 A simple counterexample is the (non-diagonalizable) operator 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & 1\\
0 & 0\end{array}\right)=\mathbf{e}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*}.\]

\end_inset

This operator has a Jordan cell with eigenvalue 0 spanned by the basis vectors
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 The eigenvector with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $0$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

, and a possible projector onto this eigenvector is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}=\mathbf{e}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 However, no polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 can yield 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}$
\end_inset

 or any other projector only onto 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 This can be seen as follows.
 We note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\hat{A}=0$
\end_inset

, and thus any polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 can be rewritten as 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}\hat{1}_{V}+a_{1}\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 However, if an operator of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}\hat{1}_{V}+a_{1}\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is a projector, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\hat{A}=0$
\end_inset

, then we can derive that 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}^{2}=a_{0}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}=2a_{0}a_{1}$
\end_inset

, which forces 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{0}=1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the only result of a polynomial formula can be the projector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}+\mathbf{e}_{2}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*}$
\end_inset

 onto the entire Jordan cell.

\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

The characteristic polynomial of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is found as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
Q_{\hat{A}}(\lambda) & =\frac{(\hat{A}-\lambda)\underbar{1}\wedge(\hat{A}-\lambda)\underbar{x}\wedge(\hat{A}-\lambda)\underbar{y}}{\underbar{1}\wedge\underbar{x}\wedge\underbar{y}}\\
 & =\lambda^{2}-\lambda^{3}\equiv q_{0}-q_{1}\lambda+q_{2}\lambda^{2}-q_{3}\lambda^{3}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda=0$
\end_inset

 is an eigenvalue of algebraic multiplicity 2.
 It is easy to guess the eigenvectors, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}=\underbar{1}$

 However, let us pretend that we do not know the Jordan basis, and instead
 determine the projector

 We note that in our example,

\begin_inset Formula $S:V\times V\rightarrow\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 is a scalar product in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 requires proving that 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is a bilinear form satisfying certain properties.
 For instance, the zero function 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{w}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 is symmetric but is not a scalar product because it is degenerate.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The above definition of the scalar product is an 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

abstract definition
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 because it does not specify any particular scalar product in a given vector
 space.
 To specify a scalar product, one usually gives an explicit formula for
 computing 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 In the same space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, one could consider different scalar products.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example 1:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the space 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
\end_inset

, the standard scalar product is
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\left\langle \left(x_{1},...,x_{N}\right),\left(y_{1},...,y_{N}\right)\right\rangle \equiv\sum_{j=1}^{N}x_{j}y_{j}.\label{eq:standard scalar product}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Let us verify that this defines a symmetric, nondegenerate, and positive-definit
e bilinear form.
 This is a bilinear form because it depends linearly on each 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 and on each 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 This form is symmetric because it is invariant under the interchange of
 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $y_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 This form is nondegenerate because for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\neq0$
\end_inset

 at least one of 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

, say 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

, is nonzero; then the scalar product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 with the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}\equiv\left(1,0,0,...,0\right)$
\end_inset

 is nonzero.
 So for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\neq0$
\end_inset

 there exists 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{w}\right\rangle \neq0$
\end_inset

, which is the nondegeneracy property.
 Finally, the scalar product is positive-definite because for any nonzero
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 there is at least one nonzero 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

 and thus 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle =\left\langle \left(x_{1},...,x_{N}\right),\left(x_{1},...,x_{N}\right)\right\rangle \equiv\sum_{j=1}^{N}x_{j}^{2}>0.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The fact that a bilinear form is nondegenerate does not mean that it must
 always be nonzero on any two vectors.
 It is perfectly possible that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right\rangle =0$
\end_inset

 while 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\neq0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 In the usual Euclidean space, this would mean that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 are orthogonal to each other.
 Nondegeneracy means that no vector is orthogonal to

\begin_layout Standard
Any orthonormal set of vectors is linearly independent.

Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If an orthonormal set

By assumption, there exists an index

 there exists another number

 Then there exists an orthonormal basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can build a basis by the standard orthogonalization procedure (the 
\series bold

\series default

\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Gram-Schmidt procedure}

\end_inset

).
 This procedure uses induction to determine a sequence of orthonormal sets
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=1,$
\end_inset

 ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Basis of induction: Choose any nonzero vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

 and compute 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

; since 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\neq0$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}\right\rangle >0$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}\right\rangle }$
\end_inset

 exists, and we can define 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{e}_{1}\equiv\frac{\mathbf{v}}{\sqrt{\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}\right\rangle }}.\]

\end_inset

It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{1}\right\rangle =1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Induction step: If 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is an orthonormal set, we need to find a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k+1}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{k},\mathbf{e}_{k+1}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is again an orthonormal set.
 To find a suitable vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k+1}$
\end_inset

, we first take any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 such that the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{k},\mathbf{v}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent; such 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 exists if 
\begin_inset Formula $k<N$
\end_inset

, while for 
\begin_inset Formula $k=N$
\end_inset

 there is nothing left to prove.
 Then we define a new vector
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{w}\equiv\mathbf{v}-\sum_{j=1}^{k}\left\langle \mathbf{e}_{j},\mathbf{v}\right\rangle \mathbf{e}_{j}.\]

\end_inset

This vector has the property 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{e}_{j},\mathbf{w}\right\rangle =0$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $1\leq j\leq k$
\end_inset

.
 We have 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}\neq0$
\end_inset

 because (by construction) 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is not a linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

; therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{w},\mathbf{w}\right\rangle >0$
\end_inset

.
 Finally, we define 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{e}_{k+1}\equiv\frac{\mathbf{w}}{\sqrt{\left\langle \mathbf{w},\mathbf{w}\right\rangle }},\]

\end_inset

so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{e}_{k+1},\mathbf{e}_{k+1}\right\rangle =1$
\end_inset

; then the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{k},\mathbf{e}_{k+1}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is orthonormal.
 So the required set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{k+1}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is now constructed.

Question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What about number fields

\end_inset

?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In that case, an orthonormal basis may or may not exist.
 For example, suppose that we consider vectors in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{Q}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and the scalar product 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle (x_{1},x_{2}),(y_{1},y_{2})\right\rangle =x_{1}y_{1}+5x_{2}y_{2}.\]

\end_inset

Then we cannot normalize the vectors: there exists no vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\equiv\left(x_{1},x_{2}\right)\in\mathbb{Q}^{2}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle =x_{1}^{2}+5x_{2}^{2}=1$
\end_inset

.
 The proof of this is similar to the ancient proof of the irrationality
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, there exists no orthonormal basis in this space with this scalar
 product.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Theorem 2:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $

\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}v_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j},\quad v_{j}\equiv\left\langle \mathbf{e}_{j},\mathbf{v}\right\rangle .\]

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Theorem\InsetSpace ~

 As we have seen before, the component

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}$
\end_inset

 from the dual basis, 
\begin_inset Formula $v_{j}=\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}(\mathbf{v})$

 Hence, the dual basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\right\} $

 consists of linear functions 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $

 The required scalar product is defined by the bilinear form
\begin_inset Formula \[
S\left(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\left(\mathbf{u}\right)\,\mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right).\]

 It is easy to show that the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $S(\mathbf{e}_{i},\mathbf{e}_{j})=\delta_{ij}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta_{ij}$

 is the Kronecker symbol
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Kronecker symbol}

 It remains to prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is nondegenerate and positive-definite.
 To prove the nondegeneracy: Suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\neq0$
\end_inset

; then we can decompose 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}=\sum_{j=1}^{N}u_{j}\mathbf{e}_{j}.\]

\end_inset

There will be at least one nonzero coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{s}$
\end_inset

, thus 
\begin_inset Formula $S\left(\mathbf{e}_{s},\mathbf{u}\right)=u_{s}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 To prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 is positive-definite, compute 
\begin_inset Formula \[
S\left(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{u}\right)=\sum_{j=1}^{N}u_{j}^{2}>0\]

\end_inset

as long as at least one coefficient 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{j}$
\end_inset

 is nonzero.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the properties of the scalar product are related in an essential
 way to the assumption that we are working with real numbers.
 As an example of what could go wrong if we naively extended the same results
 to complex vector spaces, let us consider a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\left(1,\text{i}\right)\in\mathbb{C}^{2}$
\end_inset

 and compute its scalar product with itself by the formula
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle =x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}=1^{2}+\text{i}^{2}=0.\]

\end_inset

Hence we have a nonzero vector whose 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

length
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 is zero.
 To correct this problem when working with complex numbers, one usually
 considers a different kind of scalar product designed for complex vector
 spaces.
 For instance, the scalar product in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{C}^{n}$
\end_inset

 is defined by the formula
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle (x_{1},...,x_{n}),\,(y_{1},...,y_{n})\right\rangle =\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_{j}^{*}y_{j},\]

\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is the complex conjugate of the component 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 This scalar product is called 
\series bold
Hermitian
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Hermitian scalar product}

\end_inset

 and has the property
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right\rangle =\left\langle \mathbf{y},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle ^{*},\]

\end_inset

that is, it is not symmetric but becomes complex-conjugated when the order
 of vectors is interchanged.
 According to this scalar product, we have for the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\left(1,\text{i}\right)\in\mathbb{C}^{2}$
\end_inset

 a sensible result, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle =x_{1}^{*}x_{1}+x_{2}^{*}x_{2}=\left|1\right|^{2}+\left|\text{i}\right|^{2}=2.\]

\end_inset

 More generally, for 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\neq0$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle =\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left|x_{i}\right|^{2}>0.\]

\end_inset

 In this text, I will use this kind of scalar product only once (Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Scalar-product-for-complex}

\begin_layout Subsection

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us temporarily consider the scalar product 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 as a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 for a 
\emph on
fixed
\emph default
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 We may denote this function by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}:\mathbf{x}\mapsto\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is a linear map 
\begin_inset Formula $V\rightarrow\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
(by definition) an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Thus, a covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}\in V^{*}$
\end_inset

 is determined for every 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore we have defined a map 
\begin_inset Formula $V\rightarrow V^{*}$
\end_inset

 whereby a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 is mapped to the covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

, which is defined by its action on vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 as follows,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbf{v}\mapsto\mathbf{f}^{*};\quad\mathbf{f}^{*}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\equiv\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle ,\quad\forall\mathbf{x}\in V.\label{eq:v vstar iso}\end{equation}

\end_inset

This map is an isomorphism between 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

 (not a canonical one, since it depends on the choice of the scalar product),
 as the following statement shows.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement 1:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A nondegenerate bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $B:V\otimes V\rightarrow\mathbb{K}$
\end_inset

 defines an isomorphism 
\begin_inset Formula $V\rightarrow V^{*}$
\end_inset

 by the formula 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\mapsto\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{x})\equiv B(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x})$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We need to show that the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}:V\rightarrow V^{*}$
\end_inset

 is a linear one-to-one (bijective) map.
 Linearity easily follows from the bilinearity of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 Bijectivity requires that no two different vectors are mapped into one
 and the same covector, and that any covector is an image of some vector.
 If two vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\neq\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 are mapped into one covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}\left(\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{v}\right)=\mathbf{f}^{*}-\mathbf{f}^{*}=0\in V^{*}$
\end_inset

, in other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x}\right)=0$
\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

.
 However, from the nondegeneracy of 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 it follows that there exists 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in V$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $B\left(\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{v},\mathbf{x}\right)\neq0$
\end_inset

, which gives a contradiction.
 Finally, consider a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Its image 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\hat{B}\mathbf{v}_{1},...,\hat{B}\mathbf{v}_{N}\}$
\end_inset

 must be a linearly independent set in 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

 because a vanishing linear combination 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sum_{k}\lambda_{k}\hat{B}\mathbf{v}_{k}=0=\hat{B}\big(\sum_{k}\lambda_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}\big)\]

\end_inset

 entails 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{k}\lambda_{k}\mathbf{v}_{k}=0$
\end_inset

 (we just proved that a nonzero vector cannot be mapped into the zero covector).
 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\hat{B}\mathbf{v}_{1},...,\hat{B}\mathbf{v}_{N}\}$
\end_inset

 is a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$
\end_inset

, and any covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is a linear combination 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{f}^{*}=\sum_{k}f_{k}^{*}\hat{B}\mathbf{v}_{k}=\hat{B}\big(\sum_{k}f_{k}^{*}\mathbf{v}_{k}\big).\]

\end_inset

 It follows that any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is an image of some vector from 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 is a one-to-one map.

Let us show explicitly how to use the scalar product in order to map vectors

\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We use the scalar product as the bilinear form 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

, so 
\begin_inset Formula $B(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\equiv\left\langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is an orthonormal basis.
 What is the covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

? By Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:v vstar iso}

\end_inset

), this covector acts on an arbitrary vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{B}\mathbf{e}_{1}(\mathbf{x})=\left\langle \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle \equiv x_{1},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

 is the first component of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 in the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{i}\mathbf{e}_{i}$
\end_inset

 We find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is the same as the covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}$
\end_inset

 from the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 dual to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose

 is a given covector.
 What is its pre-image

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{x})=\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in V$
\end_inset

 In order to determine

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

 instead of

\end_inset

; we then obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{e}_{j})=\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{e}_{j}\right\rangle .\]

\end_inset

Since the covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is given, the numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{e}_{j})$
\end_inset

 are known, and hence 
\begin_inset Formula \[

 than symmetric.

\begin_layout Subsection
Scalar product in index notation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the index notation, the scalar product tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $S\in V^{*}\otimes V^{*}$
\end_inset

 is represented by a matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $S_{ij}$
\end_inset

 (with lower indices), and so the scalar product of two vectors is written
 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right\rangle =u^{i}v^{j}S_{ij}.\]

\end_inset

Alternatively, one uses the vector-to-covector map 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{S}:V\rightarrow V^{*}$
\end_inset

 and writes
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle \mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\right\rangle =\mathbf{u}^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)=u_{i}v^{i},\]

\end_inset

where the covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}^{*}$
\end_inset

 is defined by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}^{*}\equiv\hat{S}\mathbf{u}\,\,\Rightarrow\,\, u_{i}\equiv S_{ij}u^{j}.\]

\end_inset

Typically, in the index notation one uses the same symbol to denote a vector,
 
\begin_inset Formula $u^{i}$
\end_inset

, and the corresponding covector, 
\begin_inset Formula $u_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 This is unambiguous as long as the scalar product is fixed.

\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{v}_{i},\mathbf{y}\right\rangle =0$

 Since the scalar product is linear, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle \mathbf{v}_{i},\,\mathbf{x}+\lambda\mathbf{y}\right\rangle =0,\quad i=1,...,n.\]

\end_inset

Therefore, any linear combination of

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}$
\end_inset

 also belongs to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{n}\right\} ^{\perp}$

\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{v}_{i},\mathbf{y}\right\rangle =0$

 Such a basis exists (see Exercise\InsetSpace ~

 Then every vector

\mathbf{x}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}\mathbf{u}_{i}+\sum_{i=n+1}^{N}\mu_{i}\mathbf{e}_{i}\equiv\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{w}.\]

This decomposition provides the required decomposition of

It remains to show that this decomposition is unique (in particular, independent

 If there were two different such decompositions, say

 and hence find that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{u}^{\prime}$

\begin_inset Formula $n<N$
\end_inset

 (or else 
\begin_inset Formula $U=V$
\end_inset

 and there exists only one projector onto 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

, namely the identity operator, which preserves the scalar product, so there
 is nothing left to prove).
 We may complete the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{1},...,\mathbf{u}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 to a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{1},...,\mathbf{u}_{n},\mathbf{e}_{n+1},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in the entire space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{1}^{*},...,\mathbf{u}_{n}^{*},\mathbf{e}_{n+1}^{*},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 be the corresponding dual basis.
 Then a projector onto 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 can be defined by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{P}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{u}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{u}_{i}^{*},\]

\end_inset

that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 simply omits the components of the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 parallel to any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $j=n+1,...,N$
\end_inset

).
 For example, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}$
\end_inset

 maps the linear combination 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\mathbf{u}_{1}+\mu\mathbf{e}_{n+1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\mathbf{u}_{1}$
\end_inset

, omitting the component parallel to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{n+1}$
\end_inset

.
 There are infinitely many ways of choosing 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\,|\, j=n+1,...,N\right\} $
\end_inset

; for instance, one can add to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{n+1}$
\end_inset

 an arbitrary linear combination of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and obtain another possible choice of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{n+1}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence there are infinitely many possible projectors onto 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While all these projectors satisfy the projection property, not all of them
 preserve the scalar product.
 The orthogonal projector is the one obtained from a particular completion
 of the basis, namely such that every vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

 is orthogonal to every vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 Such a basis exists (see Exercise\InsetSpace ~
2 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Orthonormal-bases}

\end_inset

).
 Using the construction shown above, we obtain a projector that we will
 denote 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}_{U}$
\end_inset

.
 We will now show that this projector is unique and satisfies the scalar
 product preservation property.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The scalar product is preserved for the following reason.
 For any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in V$
\end_inset

, we have a unique decomposition 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{u}+\mathbf{w}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\in U$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{w}\in U^{\perp}$
\end_inset

.
 The definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}_{U}$
\end_inset

 guarantees that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}_{U}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{a}\right\rangle =\left\langle \mathbf{u}+\mathbf{w},\mathbf{a}\right\rangle =\left\langle \mathbf{u},\mathbf{a}\right\rangle =\langle\hat{P}_{U}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{a}\rangle,\quad\forall\mathbf{x}\in V,\:\mathbf{a}\in U.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now the uniqueness: If there were two projectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}_{U}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{P}_{U}^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, both satisfying the scalar product preservation property, then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\langle(\hat{P}_{U}-\hat{P}_{U}^{\prime})\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u}\rangle=0\quad\forall\mathbf{x}\in V,\:\mathbf{u}\in U.\]

\end_inset

For a given 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in V$
\end_inset

, the vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}\equiv(\hat{P}_{U}-\hat{P}_{U}^{\prime})\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 belongs to 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 and is orthogonal to every vector in 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{y}=0$
\end_inset

.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $(\hat{P}_{U}-\hat{P}_{U}^{\prime})\mathbf{x}=0$
\end_inset

 for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in V$
\end_inset

the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $(\hat{P}_{U}-\hat{P}_{U}^{\prime})$

 It seems (judging from the proof of Statement\InsetSpace ~
3) that we need to chose a
 basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 However, the projector (as we know) is in fact independent of the choice
 of the basis and can be constructed as follows:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{P}_{\mathbf{v}^{\perp}}\mathbf{x}\equiv\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{v}\frac{\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle }{\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}\right\rangle }.\]

 the difference of any two vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{2}$
\end_inset

, both belonging to the hyperplane, satisfies
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle \mathbf{n},\mathbf{x}_{1}-\mathbf{x}_{2}\right\rangle =0.\]

\end_inset

Hence, all vectors in the hyperplane can be represented as a sum of one
 such vector, say 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}_{0}$
\end_inset

, and an arbitrary vector orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Geometrically, this means that the hyperplane is orthogonal to the vector
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 and may be shifted from the origin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us consider an affine hyperplane given by the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{n},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle =1$
\end_inset

, and let us compute the shortest vector belonging to the hyperplane.
 Any vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\in V$
\end_inset

 can be written as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{x}=\lambda\mathbf{n}+\mathbf{b},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 is some vector such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{n},\mathbf{b}\right\rangle =0$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 belongs to the hyperplane, we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
1=\left\langle \mathbf{n},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle =\left\langle \mathbf{n},\lambda\mathbf{n}+\mathbf{b}\right\rangle =\lambda\left\langle \mathbf{n},\mathbf{n}\right\rangle .\]

\end_inset

Hence, we must have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\lambda=\frac{1}{\left\langle \mathbf{n},\mathbf{n}\right\rangle }.\]

\end_inset

The squared length of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is then computed as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left\langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle  & =\lambda^{2}\left\langle \mathbf{n},\mathbf{n}\right\rangle +\left\langle \mathbf{b},\mathbf{b}\right\rangle \\
 & =\frac{1}{\left\langle \mathbf{n},\mathbf{n}\right\rangle }+\left\langle \mathbf{b},\mathbf{b}\right\rangle \geq\frac{1}{\left\langle \mathbf{n},\mathbf{n}\right\rangle }.\end{align*}

\end_inset

The inequality becomes an equality when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}=0$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
when 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\lambda\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the smallest possible length of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\lambda}$
\end_inset

, which is equal to the inverse length of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$

\begin_layout Standard
Rotation by a fixed angle is an orthogonal transformation in a Euclidean
 plane.
 It is easy to see that such a rotation preserves scalar products (angles
 and lengths are preserved by a rotation).
 Let us define this transformation by a formula.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a positively oriented orthonormal basis in the Euclidean plane, then
 we define the

\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}_{\alpha}$

 in the counter-clockwise direction by 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{R}_{\alpha}\mathbf{e}_{1} & \equiv\mathbf{e}_{1}\cos\alpha-\mathbf{e}_{2}\sin\alpha,\\
\hat{R}_{\alpha}\mathbf{e}_{2} & \equiv\mathbf{e}_{1}\sin\alpha+\mathbf{e}_{2}\cos\alpha.\end{align*}

\end_inset

One can quickly verify that the transformed basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\hat{R}_{\alpha}\mathbf{e}_{1},\hat{R}_{\alpha}\mathbf{e}_{2}\}$
\end_inset

 is also an orthonormal basis; for example, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\langle\hat{R}_{\alpha}\mathbf{e}_{1},\hat{R}_{\alpha}\mathbf{e}_{1}\rangle=\left\langle \mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{1}\right\rangle \cos^{2}\alpha+\left\langle \mathbf{e}_{2},\mathbf{e}_{2}\right\rangle \sin^{2}\alpha=1.\]

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}^{T}:V^{*}\rightarrow V^{*}$

\begin_inset Formula $V$

\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 (rather than in 
\begin_inset Formula $V^{*}$

 Let us also denote that operator by

\end_inset

 for all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\in V$

 Then we use the definition of

 Namely, any tensor

\begin_layout Standard
As we have seen before, tensors from 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

 have the interpretation of oriented volumes.
 In this interpretation, 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 represents the volume of a parallelepiped spanned by the unit basis vectors
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Since the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 are orthonormal and have unit length, it is reasonable to assume that they
 span a 
\emph on
unit

 Hence, the oriented volume represented by 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

 depending on the orientation of the basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
Once

\begin_layout Standard
It might appear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$
\end_inset

 is arbitrarily chosen and will change when we select another orthonormal

 However, it turns out that the basis tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 does not actually depend on the choice of the orthonormal basis, 
\emph on

 (The sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 is necessarily ambiguous because one can always interchange, say, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

 in the orthonormal basis, and then the sign of 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 again either 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega$

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $-\omega$

 In other words,

\begin_inset Formula $\omega\equiv\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}$

 The choice of sign of

\begin_layout Standard
Further, the space

 A 2-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\wedge^{2}V$

 by the formula
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{x})\equiv\frac{\mathbf{x}\wedge A}{\omega},\quad\forall\mathbf{x}\in V.\]

Now the identification of vectors and covectors shows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$

 Thus, a 2-vector

 Therefore 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}=\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*}$

 By the vector-covector correspondence, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}$

\end_inset

 is a vector then 
\begin_inset Formula $*(\mathbf{n})$
\end_inset

 is a bivector that may represent some parallelogram orthogonal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{n}$
\end_inset

 with the appropriate area.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another geometric example is the computation of the intersection of two
 planes: If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}\wedge\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

 represent two parallelograms in space then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
*\big([*(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b})]\wedge[*(\mathbf{c}\wedge\mathbf{d})]\big)=(\mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b})\times(\mathbf{c}\times\mathbf{d})\]

\end_inset

is a vector parallel to the line of intersection of the two planes containing
 the two parallelograms.
 While in three dimensions the Hodge star yields the same results as the
 cross product, the advantage of the Hodge star is that it is defined in
 any dimensions, as the next section shows.

 (Alternatively, the choice of

The Hodge star
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Hodge star!general definition}

 can be also defined more generally as a map of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}V$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N-k}V$
\end_inset

.
 The construction of the Hodge star map is as follows.
 We require that it be a linear map.
 So it suffices to define the Hodge star on single-term products of the
 form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 The vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{i}\,|\, i=1,...,k\right\} $
\end_inset

 define a subspace of 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, which we temporarily denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $U\equiv\text{Span}\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 Through the scalar product, we can construct the orthogonal complement
 subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $U^{\perp}$
\end_inset

; this subspace consists of all vectors that are orthogonal to every 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{i}$
\end_inset

 We can find a basis

\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $U^{\perp}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{k}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{k+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{b}_{N}=\omega.\label{eq:hodge star def}\end{equation}

\end_inset

Then we define 
\begin_inset Formula \[
*(\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{k})\equiv\mathbf{b}_{k+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{b}_{N}\in\wedge^{N-k}V.\]

\end_inset

 The coefficient of proportionality is fixed by Eq.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_layout Standard
The volume of the parallelepiped spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j}\right\} $

\begin_inset Formula \[
\text{Vol}\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j}\right\} =\frac{\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{N}}{\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a positively oriented orthonormal basis.
 Let us introduce an auxiliary transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}$
\end_inset

 that maps 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

; such a transformation surely exists and is invertible.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}\mathbf{e}_{j}=\mathbf{v}_{j}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,N$
\end_inset

), we have
\begin_inset Formula \[
\det\hat{M}=\frac{\hat{M}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{M}\mathbf{e}_{N}}{\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}}=\frac{\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}}{\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}}=\text{Vol}\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} .\]

\end_inset

Consider the transposed operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}^{T}$
\end_inset

 (the transposition is performed using the scalar product, see Definition\InsetSpace ~

 We can now show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}^{T}$

 maps the dual basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 To show this, we consider the scalar products 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\langle\mathbf{e}_{i},\hat{M}^{T}\mathbf{u}_{j}\rangle=\langle\hat{M}\mathbf{e}_{i},\mathbf{u}_{j}\rangle=\left\langle \mathbf{v}_{i},\mathbf{u}_{j}\right\rangle =\delta_{ij}.\]

\end_inset

Since the above is true for any 
\begin_inset Formula $i,j=1,...,N$
\end_inset

, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}^{T}\mathbf{u}_{j}=\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

 as desired.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{M}^{T}=\det\hat{M}$

\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}=\hat{M}^{T}\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{M}^{T}\mathbf{u}_{N}=(\det\hat{M})\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{N}.\]

\end_inset

It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\text{Vol}\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j}\right\} =\frac{\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{N}}{\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}}=\frac{1}{\det\hat{M}}=\frac{1}{\text{Vol}\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} }.\]

If a scalar product is given in

 This is fully analogous to computing the lengths of vectors through the
 scalar product in

 A vector

 of a straight line segment between two points; the length is found as 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{v}\right\rangle }$
\end_inset

 using the scalar product in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 Similarly, a tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}\in\wedge^{k}V$
\end_inset

 represents at once the orientation and the volume of a parallelepiped spanned
 by the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $

 Let us also choose some orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\,|\, j=1,...,N\right\} $
\end_inset

 There exists a linear transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $

 Then we have

\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

It follows that the matrix

 Therefore,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\det(G_{ij})=\det(\hat{A}^{T}\hat{A})=(\det\hat{A})^{2}.\]

Finally, we note that the volume 
\begin_inset Formula $v$

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Consider the orthogonal projection of the given 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al parallelepiped onto some 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-dimensional coordinate hyperplane, e.g.\InsetSpace ~
onto the hyperplane 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Span}\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Each vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is projected orthogonally, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
by omitting the components of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 at 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k+1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us denote the projected vectors by 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{i}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,k$
\end_inset

).
 The projection is a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-dimensional parallelepiped spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 in the coordinate hyperplane.
 Let us now restrict attention to the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Span}\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 In this subspace, the oriented 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-dimensional volume of the projected parallelepiped is represented by the
 tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}\equiv\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{v}}_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 By construction, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}$
\end_inset

 is proportional to the unit volume tensor in the subspace, 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}=\lambda\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

 for some 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the oriented 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al volume of the projected parallelepiped is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now decompose the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi$
\end_inset

 into the basis tensors in 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}V$
\end_inset

,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\psi & =\sum_{1\leq i_{1}<...<i_{k}\leq N}c_{i_{1}...i_{k}}\omega_{i_{1}...i_{k}}\\
 & =c_{1...k}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{k}+c_{13...(k+1)}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{k+1}+...,\end{align*}

\end_inset

where we have only written down the first two of the 
\begin_inset Formula ${N \choose k}$
\end_inset

 possible terms of the expansion.
 The projection of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 onto the hyperplane 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Span}\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 removes the components proportional to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{k+1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

, hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\psi}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the first term 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1...k}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{k}$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, the oriented volume of the projection onto the hyperplane 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Span}\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{1},...,\mathbf{e}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{1...k}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By definition of the scalar product in 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}V$
\end_inset

, all the basis tensors 
\begin_inset Formula $\omega_{i_{1}...i_{k}}$
\end_inset

 are orthonormal.
 Hence, the coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{i_{1}...i_{k}}$
\end_inset

 can be computed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
c_{i_{1}...i_{k}}=\left\langle \psi,\mathbf{e}_{i_{1}}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{i_{k}}\right\rangle \equiv\left\langle \psi,\omega_{i_{1}...i_{k}}\right\rangle .\]

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{multi-index}

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $I\equiv\left\{ i_{1},...,i_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and rewrite the above as
\begin_inset Formula \[
c_{I}=\left\langle \psi,\omega_{I}\right\rangle .\]

\end_inset

 Then the value 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \psi,\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 can be computed as 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left\langle \psi,\psi\right\rangle  & =\big\langle\sum_{I}c_{I}\omega_{I},\sum_{J}c_{J}\omega_{J}\big\rangle=\sum_{I,J}c_{I}c_{J}\left\langle \omega_{I},\omega_{J}\right\rangle \\
 & =\sum_{I,J}c_{I}c_{J}\delta_{IJ}=\sum_{I}\left|c_{I}\right|^{2}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

 In other words, we have shown that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \psi,\psi\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is equal to the sum of all 
\begin_inset Formula ${N \choose k}$
\end_inset

 squared projected volumes,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle \psi,\psi\right\rangle =\sum_{1\leq i_{1}<...<i_{k}\leq N}\left|c_{i_{1}...i_{k}}\right|^{2}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\left\langle \psi,\psi\right\rangle }$
\end_inset

 is actually equal to the unoriented volume 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 of the parallelepiped.
 To this end, let us choose a new orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,N$
\end_inset

) such that every vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,k$
\end_inset

) lies entirely within the hyperplane spanned by the first 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 basis vectors.
 (This choice of basis is certainly possible, for instance, by choosing
 an orthonormal basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Span}\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and then completing it to an orthonormal basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.) Then we will have 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi=\tilde{\lambda}\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{k}$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
with zero coefficients for all other basis tensors.
 Restricting attention to the subspace 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Span}\left\{ \tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{1},...,\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

, we can use the results of Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Scalar-product-in-lambdaNv}

\end_inset

 to find that the volume 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $|\tilde{\lambda}|$
\end_inset

.
 It remains to show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\left\langle \psi,\psi\right\rangle }=|\tilde{\lambda}|$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The transformation from the old basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 can be performed using a certain orthogonal transformation 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}\mathbf{e}_{j}=\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{j}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,...,N)$
\end_inset

.
 Since the scalar product in 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}V$
\end_inset

 is defined directly through scalar products of vectors in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 (Exercise\InsetSpace ~
1) and since 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{R}$
\end_inset

 is orthogonal, we have for any 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{b}_{i}\right\} $
\end_inset

 that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \langle\hat{R}\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{R}\mathbf{a}_{k},\hat{R}\mathbf{b}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{R}\mathbf{b}_{k}\rangle=\det\langle\hat{R}\mathbf{a}_{i},\hat{R}\mathbf{b}_{j}\rangle\\
 & \quad=\det\left\langle \mathbf{a}_{i},\mathbf{b}_{j}\right\rangle =\left\langle \mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{a}_{k},\mathbf{b}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{b}_{k}\right\rangle .\end{align*}

\end_inset

 In other words, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}\hat{R}^{k}$
\end_inset

 is an 
\emph on
orthogonal
\emph default
 
\emph on
transformation
\emph default
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{k}V$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\psi & =\tilde{\lambda}\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{k}=\tilde{\lambda}\hat{R}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{R}\mathbf{e}_{k}=\tilde{\lambda}\big({\wedge^{k}\hat{R}^{k}}\omega_{1...k}\big);\\
\left\langle \psi,\psi\right\rangle  & =\tilde{\lambda}^{2}\langle\wedge^{k}\hat{R}^{k}\omega_{1...k},\wedge^{k}\hat{R}^{k}\omega_{1...k}\rangle=\tilde{\lambda}^{2}\left\langle \omega_{1...k},\omega_{1...k}\right\rangle =\tilde{\lambda}^{2}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{\left\langle \psi,\psi\right\rangle }=|\tilde{\lambda}|=v$
\end_inset

 as required.

\end_inset

We would like to determine the volume of the parallelepiped.
 We compute the wedge product 
\begin_inset Formula $\psi\equiv\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}$
\end_inset

 using Gaussian elimination,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}

We see that the volumes of the projections onto the four coordinate hyperplanes

 Here we follow the definition used in the physics literature.
 This definition is designed to be compatible with the Dirac notation for
 complex spaces (see Example 3 below).

\begin_layout Standard
In the vector space

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}=\left(x_{1},...,x_{n}\right)$

 A Hermitian scalar product is defined by the formula
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left\langle \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right\rangle =\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{*}y_{i}.\]

This scalar product is nondegenerate and positive-definite.

 We can construct a

 Then we consider the tensor product

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}$
\end_inset

.
 Elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes\mathbb{C}$

 are linear combinations of terms of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\otimes\lambda$
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$

\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes\mathbb{C}$

\end_inset

: the multiplication of 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\otimes\lambda$
\end_inset

 by a complex number 
\begin_inset Formula $z$
\end_inset

 yields 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\otimes(\lambda z)$

 A Hermitian scalar product in this space is defined by
\begin_inset Formula \[

\end_inset

Here 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 It is easy to verify that the properties of a Hermitian scalar product
 are satisfied by the above definition.

\begin_layout Standard
Using the Hermitian scalar product, one defines an orthonormal basis and
 other constructions analogous to those defined using the ordinary (real)
 scalar product.
 For instance, the Hermitian scalar product allows one to identify vectors

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example 3:

\begin_layout Standard
The vector-covector correspondence in complex spaces is slightly different
 from that in real spaces.
 Consider a vector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

; the corresponding covector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{f}^{*}:V\rightarrow\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 may be defined as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{f}^{*}(\mathbf{x})\equiv\left\langle \mathbf{v},\mathbf{x}\right\rangle \in\mathbb{C}.\]

\end_inset

We denote the map 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\mapsto\mathbf{f}^{*}$

 by a dagger symbol, called 
\series bold
Hermitian

\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{Hermitian conjugate}

\end_inset

, so that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\mathbf{v}\right)^{\dagger}=\mathbf{f}^{*}$
\end_inset

.
 Due to the antilinearity of the scalar product, we have the property
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\lambda\mathbf{v}\right)^{\dagger}=\lambda^{*}\left(\mathbf{v}\right)^{\dagger}.\]

\end_inset

In the Dirac notation, one denotes covectors by the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

bra

\end_inset

 symbols such as 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle v\right|$
\end_inset

 One then may write
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\left|v\right\rangle \right)^{\dagger}=\left\langle v\right|,\]

i.e.\InsetSpace ~
one uses the same label 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\begin_inset Formula $v$

 inside the special brackets.
 We then have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\lambda\left|v\right\rangle \right)^{\dagger}=\lambda^{*}\left\langle v\right|.\]

\end_inset

The Hermitian scalar product of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is equal to the action of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\left|a\right\rangle \right)^{\dagger}$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle a|b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Thus, the scalar product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\left|b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle a\right|\lambda\left|b\right\rangle =\lambda\left\langle a|b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

\begin_inset Formula $\lambda\left|a\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|b\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda^{*}\left\langle a|b\right\rangle $

In an orthonormal basis, the matrix describing the Hermitian conjugate operator

 The space

We cannot repeat the proof of Statement\InsetSpace ~

 that the characteristic polynomial of a symmetric operator has all real

we consider the space 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes\mathbb{C}$

 as a vector space over

 In this space, we introduce a Hermitian scalar product as in Example\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Scalar-product-for-complex}

 In the space

 there is a special notion of

 vectors; these are vectors of the form

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

\end_inset

 by
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}(\mathbf{v}\otimes c)\equiv(\hat{A}\mathbf{v})\otimes c.\]

\end_inset

It is important to observe that the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 transforms real vectors into real vectors, and moreover that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is Hermitian in 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is symmetric in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is diagonalizable in 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 with real eigenvalues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to show that all the eigenvectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 can be chosen 
\emph on
real
\emph default
; this will prove that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is also diagonalizable in the original space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 So far we only know that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 has 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 eigenvectors in 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

.
 Any vector from 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 can be transformed into the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\otimes1+\mathbf{v}\otimes\text{i}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\in V$
\end_inset

.
 Let us assume that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\otimes1+\mathbf{v}\otimes\text{i}$
\end_inset

 is an eigenvector of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}=0$
\end_inset

, the eigenvector is real, and there is nothing left to prove; so we assume
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

 is real, we have
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{A}(\mathbf{u}\otimes1+\mathbf{v}\otimes\text{i}) & =(\hat{A}\mathbf{u})\otimes1+(\hat{A}\mathbf{v})\otimes\text{i}\\
 & \,{\lyxbuildrel!\above=}\,\lambda\mathbf{u}\otimes1+\lambda\mathbf{v}\otimes\text{i}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

If both 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\neq0$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\neq0$
\end_inset

, it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}$
\end_inset

 are both eigenvectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 with eigenvalue 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda$
\end_inset

.
 Hence, the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 can be diagonalized by choosing the real eigenvectors as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\otimes1$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\otimes1$
\end_inset

 instead of the complex eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}\otimes1+\mathbf{v}\otimes\text{i}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}=0$
\end_inset

, we only need to replace the complex eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\otimes\text{i}$
\end_inset

 by the equivalent real eigenvector 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}\otimes1$
\end_inset

.
 We have thus shown that the eigenvectors of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $V\otimes\mathbb{C}$
\end_inset

 can be chosen real.

Yes, it is true.
 It is a special property of an operator that there exists a scalar product

This formula defines a canonical isomorphism between the space of antisymmetric

Any 2-vector

 can be written as a sum 
\begin_inset Formula $\sum_{j=1}^{n}\mathbf{a}_{k}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{k}$
\end_inset

 using 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 terms, where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is some number such that 
\begin_inset Formula $n\leq\frac{1}{2}N$
\end_inset

 (here 
\begin_inset Formula $N\equiv\dim V$
\end_inset

), and the set of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{1},\mathbf{b}_{1},...,\mathbf{a}_{n},\mathbf{b}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By definition, a 2-vector 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is representable as a linear combination of the form 
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\mathbf{a}_{j}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{j},\]

\end_inset

with 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{j},\mathbf{b}_{j}\in V$
\end_inset

 and 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 value of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

.
 We will begin with this representation and transform it in order to minimize
 the number of terms.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The idea is to make sure that the set of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{1},\mathbf{b}_{1},...,\mathbf{a}_{n},\mathbf{b}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent.
 If this is not so, there exists a linear relation, say 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}_{1}=\beta_{1}\mathbf{b}_{1}+\sum_{j=2}^{n}\left(\alpha_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}+\beta_{j}\mathbf{b}_{j}\right),\]

\end_inset

with some coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha_{j}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 Using this relation, the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{1}$
\end_inset

 can be rewritten as 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{1}=\sum_{j=2}^{n}\left(\alpha_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}+\beta_{j}\mathbf{b}_{j}\right)\wedge\mathbf{b}_{1}.\]

\end_inset

These terms can be absorbed by other terms 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{j}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{j}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $j=2,...,N$
\end_inset

).
 For example, by rewriting
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \mathbf{a}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{2}+\alpha_{2}\mathbf{a}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{1}+\beta_{2}\mathbf{b}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{1}\\
 & \quad=(\mathbf{a}_{2}-\beta_{2}\mathbf{b}_{1})\wedge\left(\mathbf{b}_{2}+\alpha_{2}\mathbf{b}_{1}\right)\\
 & \quad\equiv\tilde{\mathbf{a}}_{2}\wedge\tilde{\mathbf{b}}_{2}\end{align*}

\end_inset

we can absorb the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(\alpha_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}+\beta_{j}\mathbf{b}_{j}\right)\wedge\mathbf{b}_{1}$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $j=2$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{2}$
\end_inset

, replacing the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}_{2}$
\end_inset

 by new vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{a}}_{2}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\tilde{\mathbf{b}}_{2}$
\end_inset

.
 In this way, we can redefine the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{j},\mathbf{b}_{j}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $j=2,...,N$
\end_inset

) so that the term 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{1}$
\end_inset

 is eliminated from the expression for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 We continue this procedure until the set of all the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}_{j},\mathbf{b}_{j}$
\end_inset

 is linearly independent.
 We now denote again by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{1},\mathbf{b}_{1},...,\mathbf{a}_{n},\mathbf{b}_{n}\right\} $
\end_inset

 the resulting linearly independent set of vectors such that the representation
 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\mathbf{a}_{j}\wedge\mathbf{b}_{j}$
\end_inset

 still holds.
 Note that the final number 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 may be smaller than the initial number.
 Since the number of vectors (
\begin_inset Formula $2n$
\end_inset

) in the final, linearly independent set 
\begin_inset Formula $\{\mathbf{a}_{1},\mathbf{b}_{1},...,\mathbf{a}_{n},\mathbf{b}_{n}\}$
\end_inset

 cannot be greater than 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, the dimension of the space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $2n\leq N$
\end_inset

 and so 
\begin_inset Formula $n\leq\frac{1}{2}N$

 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$

 is diagonalizable and has all imaginary eigenvalues.
 However, the operator

 Further, we may choose these vectors such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\bar{\mathbf{v}}_{i}$

 We now define the vectors

\hat{A}\mathbf{a}_{i}=-\lambda_{i}\mathbf{b}_{i},\quad\hat{A}\mathbf{b}_{i}=\lambda_{i}\mathbf{a}_{i}\quad(i=1,...,n).\]

\end_inset

Furthermore, the set of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{a}_{1},\mathbf{b}_{1},...,\mathbf{a}_{n},\mathbf{b}_{n}\right\} $

 is orthonormal, and all the vectors

Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The sign of the Pfaffian depends on the orientation of the orthonormal basis.
 Other than that, the Pfaffian does not depend on the choice of the orthonormal
 basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 If this ambiguity is not desired, one could consider a 
\emph on
tensor-valued
\emph default
 Pfaffian, 
\begin_inset Formula $A\wedge...\wedge A\in\wedge^{N}V$
\end_inset

; this tensor does not depend on the choice of the orientation of the orthonorma
l basis.
 This is quite similar to the ambiguity of the definition of volume and
 to the possibility of defining an unambiguous but tensor-valued 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

oriented volume.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 However, it is important to note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 must be a positively oriented 
\emph on
orthonormal
\emph default
 basis; if we change to an arbitrary basis, the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

 will be multiplied by some number not equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

, which will make the definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Pf}\,\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 impossible.

Question:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Can we define the Pfaffian of an operator if we do not have a scalar product
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

? Can we define the Pfaffian of an antisymmetric matrix?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Answer:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We need a scalar product in order to map an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\in\text{End}V$
\end_inset

 to a bivector 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\wedge^{2}V$
\end_inset

; this is central in the construction of the Pfaffian.
 If we know that an operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is antisymmetric with respect to 
\emph on
some
\emph default
 scalar product (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
if we know that such a scalar product 
\emph on
exists
\emph default
) then we can use that scalar product in order to define the Pfaffian of
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 In the language of matrices: If an antisymmetric matrix is given, we can
 postulate that this matrix represents an operator in some basis; then we
 can introduce a scalar product such that this basis is orthonormal, so
 that this operator is an antisymmetric operator with respect to this scalar
 product; and then the Pfaffian can be defined.

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To make the correspondence between operators and bivectors more visual,
 let us represent operators by their matrices in an orthonormal basis.
 Antisymmetric operators are then represented by antisymmetric matrices.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Examples:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First we consider a 
\emph on
two
\emph default
-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 Any 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 antisymmetric matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is necessarily of the form 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
0 & a\\
-a & 0\end{array}\right)$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 is some number; the determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is then 
\begin_inset Formula $a^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Let us compute the Pfaffian of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 We find the representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 as an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{2}V$
\end_inset

 as follows, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}=a\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}$
\end_inset

, and hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Pf }\hat{A}=a$
\end_inset

.
 We note that the determinant is equal to the square of the Pfaffian.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us now consider a four-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 and a 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times4$
\end_inset

 antisymmetric matrix; such a matrix must be of the form
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{B}=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
0 & a & b & c\\
-a & 0 & x & y\\
-b & -x & 0 & z\\
-c & -y & -z & 0\end{array}\right),\]

\end_inset

where the numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b,c,x,y,z$
\end_inset

 are arbitrary.
 Let us compute the Pfaffian and the determinant of the operator represented
 by this matrix.
 We find the representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 as an element of 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{2}V$
\end_inset

 as follows, 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{B} & =a\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}+b\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}+c\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{4}\\
 & \;+x\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}+y\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{4}+z\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{4}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Therefore,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{2!}\hat{B}\wedge\hat{B}=\left(az-by+cx\right)\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{3}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{4}.\]

\end_inset

(Note that the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2!}$
\end_inset

 cancels the combinatorial factor
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{combinatorial factor}

\end_inset

 2 resulting from the antisymmetry of the exterior product.) Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Pf }\hat{B}=az-by+cx$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Exercise:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Compute the determinant of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{B}$
\end_inset

 in the example above; show that 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\det\hat{B} & =a^{2}z^{2}-2abyz+b^{2}y^{2}-2bcxy+c^{2}x^{2}+2acxz.\end{align*}

\end_inset

We see that, again, the determinant is equal to the square of the Pfaffian
 (which is easier to compute).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Remark:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The factor 
\begin_inset Formula $1/(N/2)!$
\end_inset

 used in the definition of the Pfaffian is a combinatorial factor
\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{combinatorial factor}

\end_inset

.
 This factor could be inconvenient if we were calculating in a finite number
 field where one cannot divide by 
\begin_inset Formula $(N/2)!$
\end_inset

.
 This inconvenience can be avoided if we define the Pfaffian of a tensor
 
\begin_inset Formula $A=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}+...+\mathbf{v}_{n-1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{n}$
\end_inset

 as zero if 
\begin_inset Formula $n<N$
\end_inset

 and as the coefficient in the tensor equality 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}{\lyxbuildrel!\above=}(\text{Pf }\hat{A})\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}\]

\end_inset

 if 
\begin_inset Formula $n=N$
\end_inset

.
 For example, consider the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}\wedge\mathbf{d}\]

\end_inset

in a four-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al space (
\begin_inset Formula $N=4$
\end_inset

).
 We compute 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
A\wedge A & =\left(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}\wedge\mathbf{d}\right)\wedge\left(\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}+\mathbf{c}\wedge\mathbf{d}\right)\\
 & =0+\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}\wedge\mathbf{d}+\mathbf{c}\wedge\mathbf{d}\wedge\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}+0\\
 & =2\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}\wedge\mathbf{d}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

It is clear that the factor 
\begin_inset Formula $2=\left(N/2\right)!$
\end_inset

 arises due to the presence of 2 possible permutations of the two tensors
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{c}\wedge\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

 and is therefore a

\emph on

\emph default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{combinatorial factor}

\end_inset

 We can avoid the division by 2 in the definition of the Pfaffian if we
 consider the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{a}\wedge\mathbf{b}\wedge\mathbf{c}\wedge\mathbf{d}$
\end_inset

 right away, instead of dividing 
\begin_inset Formula $A\wedge A$
\end_inset

 by 2.

\begin_layout Paragraph
Theorem:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given a linear operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 in an even-dimen\SpecialChar \-
sion\SpecialChar \-
al space 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 where a scalar product is defined, and given that the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is antisymmetric with respect to that scalar product, we have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\textrm{Pf }\hat{A})^{2}=\det\hat{A}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We know that the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $A\in\wedge^{2}V$
\end_inset

 corresponding to the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 can be written in the form
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}+...+\mathbf{v}_{n-1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k},\]

\end_inset

where the set of vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is linearly independent (Statement\InsetSpace ~
2 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Antisymmetric-operators-and}

\end_inset

) and 
\begin_inset Formula $k\leq N$
\end_inset

 is an even number.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We begin by considering the case 
\begin_inset Formula $k<N$
\end_inset

.
 In this case the exterior product 
\begin_inset Formula $A\wedge...\wedge A$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is taken 
\begin_inset Formula $N/2$
\end_inset

 times) will be equal to zero because there are only 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 different vectors in that exterior product, while the total number of vectors
 is 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

, so at least two vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

 must be repeated.
 Also 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}=0$
\end_inset

 in this case; this can be shown explicitly by completing 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 to a basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{k},\mathbf{e}_{k+1},...,\mathbf{e}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 such that all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

 are orthogonal to all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 (This can be done by first completing 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{k}\right\} $
\end_inset

 to a basis and then applying the Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization procedure
 to the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{j}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $j=k+1,...,N$
\end_inset

.) Then we will have 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{j}=0$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $j=k+1,...,N$
\end_inset

).
 Acting with 
\begin_inset Formula $\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N}$
\end_inset

 on the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{k+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

, we find 
\begin_inset Formula \[
(\wedge^{N}\hat{A}^{N})(\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{k}\wedge\mathbf{e}_{k+1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N})=...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{e}_{N}=0\]

\end_inset

and hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}=0$
\end_inset

.
 Thus 
\begin_inset Formula $(\text{Pf }\hat{A})^{2}=0=\det\hat{A}$
\end_inset

, and there is nothing left to prove in case 
\begin_inset Formula $k<N$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It remains to consider the interesting case 
\begin_inset Formula $k=N$
\end_inset

.
 In this case, the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{1},...,\mathbf{v}_{N}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is a basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 The Pfaffian 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Pf }\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is the coefficient in the tensor equality
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{1}{(N/2)!}\bigwedge_{k=1}^{N/2}A=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}{\lyxbuildrel!\above=}(\text{Pf }\hat{A})\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is an orthonormal basis.
 In other words, 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Pf }\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is the (oriented) volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\,|\, j=1,...,N\right\} $
\end_inset

, if we assume that the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 span a unit volume.
 Now it is clear that 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{Pf }\hat{A}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 the dual basis to 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Due to the one-to-one correspondence between vectors and covectors, we
 map 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}^{*}\right\} $
\end_inset

 into the reciprocal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 We now apply the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 to the reciprocal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 and find by a direct calculation (using the property 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \mathbf{v}_{i},\mathbf{u}_{j}\right\rangle =\delta_{ij}$
\end_inset

) that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{u}_{1}=-\mathbf{v}_{2}$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}\mathbf{u}_{2}=\mathbf{v}_{1}$
\end_inset

, and so on.
 Hence
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\hat{A}\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{u}_{N} & =(-\mathbf{v}_{2})\wedge\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge(-\mathbf{v}_{N})\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N-1}\\
 & =\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge\mathbf{v}_{2}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is the coefficient in the tensor equality 
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\hat{A}\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{A}\mathbf{u}_{N}=\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}{\lyxbuildrel!\above=}(\det\hat{A})\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{N}.\label{eq:pfaff1}\end{equation}

\end_inset

In particular, 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}\neq0$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to prove the desired relationship between the determinant and the
 Pfaffian, it remains to compute the volume spanned by the dual basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

, so that the tensor 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{N}$
\end_inset

 can be related to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}$
\end_inset

.
 By Statement\InsetSpace ~
2 in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Reciprocal-basis}

\end_inset

, the volume spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is the inverse of the volume spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{v}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

.
 Therefore the volume spanned by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{u}_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $1/\text{Pf }\hat{A}$
\end_inset

.
 Now we can compute the Pfaffian of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 using 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{u}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{u}_{N}=(\text{Pf }\hat{A})^{-1}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}\]

\end_inset

 together with Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:pfaff1}

\end_inset

):
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\text{Pf }\hat{A} & =\frac{\mathbf{v}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{v}_{N}}{\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}}=\frac{(\det\hat{A})(\text{Pf }\hat{A})^{-1}\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}}{\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{N}}\\
 & =(\det\hat{A})(\text{Pf }\hat{A})^{-1}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\det\hat{A}=(\text{Pf }\hat{A})^{2}$

 A scalar product in 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 is defined naturally (by restriction), given the scalar product in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 We will denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\langle \cdot,\cdot\right\rangle $
\end_inset

 the scalar product in 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

.
 The given matrix form of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 means that we have a given operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}\in\text{End}\, U$
\end_inset

 such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 acts on vectors from 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \begin{equation}
\hat{A}\left(\mathbf{v}_{1}\oplus\mathbf{v}_{2}\right)=(\hat{M}\mathbf{v}_{2})\oplus(-\hat{M}^{T}\mathbf{v}_{1}),\quad\mathbf{v}_{1},\mathbf{v}_{2}\in U.\label{eq:A action v1v2}\end{equation}

\end_inset

We can choose an orthonormal basis 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{c}_{i}\,|\, i=1,...,n\right\} $
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $U$
\end_inset

 and represent the operator 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}$
\end_inset

 through some suitable vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{m}_{i}|\, i=1,...,n\right\} $
\end_inset

 (not necessarily orthogonal) such that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{M}\mathbf{u}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{m}_{i}\left\langle \mathbf{c}_{i},\mathbf{u}\right\rangle ,\quad\mathbf{u}\in U.\]

\end_inset

Note that the vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{m}_{i}$
\end_inset

 are found from 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}\mathbf{c}_{i}=\mathbf{m}_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 It follows that 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{M}^{T}\mathbf{u}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{c}_{i}\left\langle \mathbf{m}_{i},\mathbf{u}\right\rangle $
\end_inset

.
 Using Eq.\InsetSpace ~
(
\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{eq:A action v1v2}

\end_inset

), we can then write the tensor representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\hat{A}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left[(\mathbf{m}_{i}\oplus0)\otimes(0\oplus\mathbf{c}_{i})^{*}-(0\oplus\mathbf{c}_{i})\otimes(\mathbf{m}_{i}\oplus0)^{*}\right].\]

\end_inset

 Hence, 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 can be represented by the 2-vector 
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\mathbf{m}_{i}\oplus0)\wedge(0\oplus\mathbf{c}_{i})\in\wedge^{2}V.\]

\end_inset

The Pfaffian of 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{A}$
\end_inset

 is then found from 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\text{Pf }\hat{A}=\frac{(\mathbf{m}_{1}\oplus0)\wedge(0\oplus\mathbf{c}_{1})\wedge...\wedge(\mathbf{m}_{n}\oplus0)\wedge(0\oplus\mathbf{c}_{n})}{\mathbf{e}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{e}_{2n}},\]

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{i}\,|\, i=1,...,2n\right\} $
\end_inset

 is an orthonormal basis in 
\begin_inset Formula $V$
\end_inset

.
 We can choose this basis as 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{i}=\mathbf{c}_{i}\oplus0$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{e}_{n+i}=0\oplus\mathbf{c}_{i}$
\end_inset

 (for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,n$
\end_inset

).
 By introducing the sign factor 
\begin_inset Formula $(-1)^{\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)}$
\end_inset

, we may rearrange the exterior products so that all 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{m}_{i}$
\end_inset

 are together.
 Hence
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
 & \text{Pf }\hat{A}=(-1)^{\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)}\\
 & \quad\times\frac{(\mathbf{m}_{1}\oplus0)\wedge...\wedge(\mathbf{m}_{n}\oplus0)\wedge(0\oplus\mathbf{c}_{1})\wedge...\wedge(0\oplus\mathbf{c}_{n})}{\left(\mathbf{c}_{1}\oplus0\right)\wedge...\wedge(\mathbf{c}_{n}\oplus0)\wedge\left(0\oplus\mathbf{c}_{1}\right)\wedge...\wedge(0\oplus\mathbf{c}_{n})}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Vectors corresponding to different subspaces can be factorized, and then
 the factors containing 
\begin_inset Formula $0\oplus\mathbf{c}_{i}$
\end_inset

 can be canceled:
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\text{Pf }\hat{A} & =(-1)^{\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)}\frac{\mathbf{m}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{m}_{n}}{\mathbf{c}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{c}_{n}}\frac{\mathbf{c}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{c}_{n}}{\mathbf{c}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{c}_{n}}\\
 & =(-1)^{\frac{1}{2}n(n-1)}\frac{\mathbf{m}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{m}_{n}}{\mathbf{c}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{c}_{n}}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Finally, we have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\frac{\mathbf{m}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{m}_{n}}{\mathbf{c}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{c}_{n}}=\frac{\hat{M}\mathbf{c}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\hat{M}\mathbf{c}_{n}}{\mathbf{c}_{1}\wedge...\wedge\mathbf{c}_{n}}=\det\hat{M}.\]

\end_inset

This concludes the calculation.

A

 is a formal expression 
\begin_inset Formula $a+\text{i}b$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $a,b$
\end_inset

 are real numbers.
 In other words, a complex number is simply a pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(a,b\right)$
\end_inset

 of real numbers, written in a more convenient notation as 
\begin_inset Formula $a+\text{i}b$
\end_inset

 One writes, for example, 
\begin_inset Formula $2+\text{i}3$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $2+3\text{i}$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $3+\text{i}$

\begin_inset Formula $\text{i}$

\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, is not a real number; it is a symbol which has the property 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{i}^{2}=-1$
\end_inset

.
 Using this property, we can apply the usual algebraic rules to complex
 numbers; this is emphasized by the algebraic notation 
\begin_inset Formula $a+\text{i}b$
\end_inset

.
 For instance, we can add and multiply complex numbers,
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\left(1+\text{i}\right)+5\text{i} & =1+6\text{i};\\
\left(1-\text{i}\right)\left(2+\text{i}\right) & =2-2\text{i}+\text{i}-\text{i}^{2}\\
 & =3-\text{i};\\
\text{i}^{3} & =\text{i}\text{i}^{2}=-\text{i}.\end{align*}

\end_inset

It is straightforward to see that the result of any arithmetic operation
 on complex numbers turns out to be again a complex number.
 In other words, one can multiply, divide, add, subtract complex numbers
 just as directly as real numbers.

Analytic functions

Analytic

 functions are such functions

 In this sense, analytic functions are naturally extended from real to complex

In this appendix I briefly review some basic properties of permutations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We consider the ordered set 
\begin_inset Formula $(1,...,N)$
\end_inset

 of integers.
 A 
\series bold
permutation
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{permutation}

\end_inset

 of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $(1,...,N)$
\end_inset

 is a map 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma:(1,...,N)\mapsto(k_{1},...,k_{N})$
\end_inset

 where the 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{j}$
\end_inset

 are all different and again range from 1 to 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, a permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is a one-to-one map of the set 
\begin_inset Formula $(1,...,N)$
\end_inset

 to itself.
 For example,
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sigma:\left(1,2,3,4,5\right)\mapsto\left(4,1,5,3,2\right)\]

\end_inset

 is a permutation of the set of five elements.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We call a permutation 
\series bold
elementary
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{elementary permutation}

\end_inset

 if it exchanges only two adjacent numbers, for example 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,2,3,4\right)\mapsto\left(1,3,2,4\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The 
\series bold
identity
\series default
 permutation, denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\text{id}$
\end_inset

, does not permute anything.
 Two permutations 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{2}$
\end_inset

 can be executed one after another; the result is also a permutation called
 the 
\series bold
product
\series default
 (composition) of the elementary permutations 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{2}$
\end_inset

 and denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{2}\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 is executed first, and then 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{2}$
\end_inset

).
 For example, the product of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,2,3\right)\mapsto\left(1,3,2\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,2,3\right)\mapsto\left(2,1,3\right)$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,2,3\right)\mapsto\left(3,1,2\right)$
\end_inset

.
 The effect of this (non-elementary) permutation is to move 3 through 1
 and 2 into the first place.
 Note that in this way we can move any number into any other place; for
 that, we need to use as many elementary permutations as places we are passing
 through.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The set of all permutations of 
\begin_inset Formula $N$
\end_inset

 elements is a group with respect to the product of permutations.
 This group is not commutative.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For brevity, let us write EP for 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

elementary permutation.
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 Note that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\sigma=\text{id}$
\end_inset

 when 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is an EP.
 Now we will prove that the permutation group is generated by EPs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement 1:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any permutation can be represented as a product of some finite number of
 EPs.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma:\left(1,...,N\right)\mapsto\left(k_{1},...,k_{N}\right)$
\end_inset

 is a given permutation.
 Let us try to reduce it to EPs.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{1}\neq1$
\end_inset

 then 1 is somewhere among the 
\begin_inset Formula $k_{i}$
\end_inset

, say at the place 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 We can move 1 from the 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1}$
\end_inset

-th place to the first place by executing a product of 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1}-1$
\end_inset

 EPs (since we pass through 
\begin_inset Formula $i_{1}-1$
\end_inset

 places).
 Then we repeat the same operation with 2, moving it to the second place,
 and so on.
 The result will be that we obtain some (perhaps a large number of) EPs
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

, ..., 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}$
\end_inset

, such that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}...\sigma_{n}\sigma=\text{id}$
\end_inset

.
 Using the property 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}^{2}=\text{id}$
\end_inset

, we move 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

's to the right and obtain 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\sigma_{n}...\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

.
\hfill

\begin_inset Formula $\blacksquare$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Any given permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is thus equal to a product of EPs 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}$
\end_inset

, but this representation is in any case not unique because, say, we may
 insert 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{1}\sigma_{1}=\text{id}$
\end_inset

 in any place of the product 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}...\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

 without changing the result.
 So the 
\emph on
number
\emph default
 of required EPs can be changed.
 However, it is very important (and we will prove this now) that the number
 of required EPs can only be changed by 2, never by 1.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In other words, we are going to prove the following statement: When a given
 permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is represented as a product of EPs, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\sigma_{n}...\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

, the number 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 of these EPs is always either even or odd, depending on 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 but independent of the choice of the representation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{n}...\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

.
 Since the parity of 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 (
\series bold
parity
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{parity}

\end_inset

 is whether 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is even or odd) is a property of the permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 rather than of the representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 through EPs, it will make sense to say that the permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is itself 
\series bold
even
\series default
 or 
\series bold
odd
\series default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Statement 2:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is represented as a product of EPs in two different ways, namely by a product
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}$
\end_inset

 EPs and also by a product of 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{2}$
\end_inset

 EPs, then the integers 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{2}$
\end_inset

 are both even or both odd.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subparagraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us denote by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|$
\end_inset

 the 
\emph on
smallest
\emph default
 number of EPs required to represent a given permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Foot
status open

\begin_layout Standard
In Definition D0 we used the notation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|$
\end_inset

 to mean 0 or 1 for even or odd permutations.
 However, the formula uses only 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma\right|}$
\end_inset

, so the present definition of 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|$
\end_inset

 is still consistent with Definition\InsetSpace ~
D0.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 We will now show that 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|$
\end_inset

 is equal to the number of 
\series bold
order violations
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{permutation!order violations}

\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

, i.e.\InsetSpace ~
the number of instances when some larger number is situated to the left
 of some smaller number.
 For example, in the permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,2,3,4\right)\mapsto\left(4,1,3,2\right)$
\end_inset

 there are 
\emph on
four
\emph default
 order violations: the pairs 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(4,1\right)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(4,3\right)$
\end_inset

, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(4,2\right)$
\end_inset

, and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(3,2\right)$
\end_inset

.
 It is clear that the correct order can be restored only when each order
 violation is resolved, which requires 
\emph on
one
\emph default
 EP for each order violation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The construction in the proof of Statement\InsetSpace ~
1 shows that there exists a choice
 of exactly 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|$
\end_inset

 EPs whose product equals 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|$
\end_inset

 (the smallest number of EPs required to represent 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

) is indeed equal to the number of order violations in 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Now consider multiplying 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 by some EP 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

; it is clear that the number of order violations changes by 1, that is,
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma_{0}\sigma\right|=\left|\sigma\right|\pm1$
\end_inset

, depending on whether 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

 violates the order existing in 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 at the two adjacent places affected by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 For example, the permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\left(4,1,3,2\right)$
\end_inset

 has four order violations, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|=4$
\end_inset

; when we multiply 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}=\left(1,3,2,4\right)$
\end_inset

, which is an EP exchanging 2 and 3, we remove the order violation in 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 in the pair 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(1,3\right)$
\end_inset

 since 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{0}\sigma=\left(4,3,1,2\right)$
\end_inset

; hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma_{0}\sigma\right|=3$
\end_inset

.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|$
\end_inset

 is changed by 
\begin_inset Formula $\pm1$
\end_inset

, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma_{0}\sigma\right|}=-\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma\right|}$
\end_inset

 in any case.
 Now we consider two representations of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 through 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}$
\end_inset

 and through 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{2}$
\end_inset

 EPs.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\sigma_{n_{1}}...\sigma_{1}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{j}$
\end_inset

 are EPs, we find by induction 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma\right|}=\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma_{n_{1}}...\sigma_{1}\right|}=\left(-1\right)^{n_{1}}.\]

\end_inset

Similarly for the second representation.
 So it follows that 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma\right|}=\left(-1\right)^{n_{1}}=\left(-1\right)^{n_{2}}.\]

\end_inset

 Hence, the numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n_{2}$
\end_inset

 are either both even or both odd.
\hfill

\begin_inset Formula $\blacksquare$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It follows from the proof of Statement\InsetSpace ~
2 that the number 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-1\right)^{\left|\sigma\right|}$
\end_inset

 is independent of the representation of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 through EPs.
 This number is called the 
\series bold
parity
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{permutation!parity of}

\end_inset

 of a permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 For example, the permutation 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sigma:\left(1,2,3,4\right)\mapsto\left(1,4,3,2\right)\]

\end_inset

 has four order violations, 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|\sigma\right|=4$
\end_inset

, and is therefore an even permutation with parity 
\begin_inset Formula $+1$
\end_inset

.

Statement\InsetSpace ~

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The inverse permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{-1}$
\end_inset

 exists for every permutation 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

, is unique, and the parity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is the same as the parity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Proof:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By Statement\InsetSpace ~
1, we have 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=\sigma_{1}...\sigma_{n}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}$
\end_inset

 are EPs.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{i}\sigma_{i}=\text{id}$
\end_inset

, we can define explicitly the inverse permutation as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sigma^{-1}\equiv\sigma_{n}\sigma_{n-1}...\sigma_{1}.\]

\end_inset

It is obvious that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma\sigma^{-1}=\sigma^{-1}\sigma=1$
\end_inset

, and so 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{-1}$
\end_inset

 exists.
 If there were two different inverse permutations, say 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{-1}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{\prime}$
\end_inset

, we would have 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\sigma^{-1}=\sigma^{-1}\sigma\sigma^{\prime}=\sigma^{\prime}.\]

\end_inset

Therefore, the inverse is unique.
 Finally, by Statement\InsetSpace ~
2, the parity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is equal to the parity of the number 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, and thus equal to the parity of 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 (Alternatively, we may show that 
\begin_inset Formula $|\sigma^{-1}|=\left|\sigma\right|$
\end_inset

.)

\begin_layout Chapter
Matrices
\begin_inset LatexCommand \label{sec:Matrices}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This appendix is a crash course on vector and matrix algebra.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Definitions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Matrices are rectangular tables of numbers; here is an example of a 
\begin_inset Formula $4\times4$
\end_inset

 matrix:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{cccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & -\sqrt{2}\\
2 & 1 & 0 & 0\\
3 & 2 & 1 & 0\\
4 & 3 & 2 & 1\end{array}\right).\]

\end_inset

 Matrices are used whenever it is convenient to arrange some numbers in
 a rectangular table.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To write matrices symbolically, one uses two indices, for example 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is the matrix element in the 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

-th row and the 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

-th column.
 In this convention, the indices are integers ranging from 1 to each dimension
 of the matrix.
 For example, a 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times2$
\end_inset

 rectangular matrix can be written as a set of coefficients 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ B_{ij}\,|\,1\leq i\leq3,\:1\leq j\leq2\right\} $
\end_inset

 and is displayed as
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{cc}
B_{11} & B_{12}\\
B_{21} & B_{22}\\
B_{31} & B_{32}\end{array}\right).\]

\end_inset

A matrix with dimensions 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times1$
\end_inset

 is called a 
\series bold
column
\series default
 since it has the shape
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\begin{array}{c}
A_{11}\\
\vdots\\
A_{n1}\end{array}\right].\]

\end_inset

 A matrix with dimensions 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times n$
\end_inset

 is called a row since it has the shape
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
A_{11} & \dots & A_{1n}\end{array}\right].\]

\end_inset

Rows and columns are sometimes distinguished from other matrices by using
 square brackets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Matrix multiplication
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Matrices can be multiplied by a number  just like vectors: each matrix element
 is multiplied by the number.
 For example,
\begin_inset Formula \[
2\left(\begin{array}{cc}
u & v\\
w & x\\
y & z\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
2u & 2v\\
2w & 2x\\
2y & 2z\end{array}\right).\]

\end_inset

Now we will see how to multiply a matrix with another matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The easiest is to define the multiplication of a row with a column: 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{1} & a_{2} & a_{3}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_{1}\\
x_{2}\\
x_{3}\end{array}\right]=a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+a_{3}x_{3}.\]

\end_inset

So the result of a multiplication of a 
\begin_inset Formula $1\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix with an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times1$
\end_inset

 matrix is simply a number.
 The general definition is
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{1} & \dots & a_{n}\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_{1}\\
\vdots\\
x_{n}\end{array}\right]=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}x_{i}.\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let us try to guess how to define the multiplication of a column with a
 matrix consisting of 
\emph on
several
\emph default
 rows.
 Start with just two rows:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{1} & a_{2} & a_{3}\\
b_{1} & b_{2} & b_{3}\end{array}\right)\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_{1}\\
x_{2}\\
x_{3}\end{array}\right]=?\]

\end_inset

We can multiply each of the two rows with the column 
\begin_inset Formula $\left[x_{i}\right]$
\end_inset

 as before.
 Then we obtain two numbers, and it is natural to put them into a column:
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{1} & a_{2} & a_{3}\\
b_{1} & b_{2} & b_{3}\end{array}\right)\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_{1}\\
x_{2}\\
x_{3}\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+a_{3}x_{3}\\
b_{1}x_{1}+b_{2}x_{2}+b_{3}x_{3}\end{array}\right].\]

\end_inset

In general, we define the product of an 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix with an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times1$
\end_inset

 matrix (a column); the result is an 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times1$
\end_inset

 matrix (again a column):
\begin_inset Formula \[
\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a_{11} & ... & a_{1n}\\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\
a_{m1} & \dots & a_{mn}\end{array}\right)\left[\begin{array}{c}
x_{1}\\
\vdots\\
x_{n}\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{1i}x_{i}\\
\vdots\\
\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{mi}x_{i}\end{array}\right].\]

\end_inset

Finally, we can extend this definition to products of two matrices of sizes
 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times p$

 We first multiply the

\end_inset

 columns in the

\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 columns of size 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times1$
\end_inset

, and then arrange these 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 columns into an 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times p$
\end_inset

 matrix.
 The resulting general definition can be written as a formula for matrix
 multiplication: if 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 is an 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times n$
\end_inset

 matrix and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 One introduces the column vectors 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{x}\equiv{x \choose y}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{b}\equiv{-11 \choose 6}$
\end_inset

 and the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula \[
A\equiv\left(\begin{array}{cc}

\end_inset

Then the above system of equations is equivalent to the single matrix equation,
 
\begin_inset Formula \[
A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b},\]

\begin_layout Section
Determinants
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the construction of the inverse matrix for a given matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

, one finds a formula of a peculiar type: Each element of the inverse matrix
 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{-1}$
\end_inset

 is equal to some polynomial in 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

, divided by a certain function of 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

.
 For example, Exercise\InsetSpace ~
1a in Sec.\InsetSpace ~

\begin_inset LatexCommand \ref{sub:Inverse-matrix}

\end_inset

 gives such a formula for 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times2$
\end_inset

 matrices; that formula contains the expression 
\begin_inset Formula $wz-xy$
\end_inset

 in every denominator.

\emph on

\emph on

\begin_inset Formula $A^{-1}$

 This expression needs to be nonzero in that formula, or else we cannot
 divide by it (and then the inverse matrix does not exist).
 In other words, this expression (which is a function of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

) 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

determines
\begin_inset Quotes erd

 whether the inverse matrix exists.

\end_inset

Determinants are also sometimes written as matrices with straight vertical
 lines at both sides, e.g.
\begin_inset Formula \[
\det\left(\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 2\\
0 & 3\end{array}\right)\equiv\left|\begin{array}{cc}
1 & 2\\
0 & 3\end{array}\right|=3.\]

\end_inset

In this notation, a determinant resembles a matrix, so it requires that
 we clearly distinguish between a matrix (a table of numbers) and a determinant
 (which is a 
\emph on
single number
\emph default
 computed from a matrix).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To compute the determinant of an arbitrary

\begin_inset Formula $A$

 First one defines the notion of a

minor
\series default

\begin_inset LatexCommand \index{minor}

\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{ij}$
\end_inset

 corresponding to some element 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{ij}$
\end_inset

: By definition, 
\begin_inset Formula $M_{ij}$
\end_inset

 is the determinant of a matrix obtained from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 by deleting row 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 and column 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

.
 For example, the minor corresponding to the element 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 of the matrix 
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a & b & c\\
p & q & r\\
x & y & z\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

is the minor corresponding to 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{12}$
\end_inset

, hence we delete row 1 and column 2 from 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and obtain
\begin_inset Formula \[
M_{12}=\left|\begin{array}{cc}
p & r\\
x & z\end{array}\right|=pz-rx.\]

\end_inset

 Then, one sums over all the elements 
\begin_inset Formula $A_{1i}$
\end_inset

 (
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,...,n$
\end_inset

) in the first row of 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, multiplied by the corresponding minors and the sign factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-1\right)^{i-1}$
\end_inset

.
 In other words, the Laplace expansion is the formula
\begin_inset Formula \[
\det(A)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(-1\right)^{i-1}A_{1i}M_{1i}.\]

\end_inset

A similar formula holds for any other row 
\begin_inset Formula $j$
\end_inset

 instead of the first row; one needs an additional sign factor 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(-1\right)^{j-1}$
\end_inset

 in that case.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Example:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We compute the determinant of the matrix
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a & b & c\\
p & q & r\\
x & y & z\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

 using the Laplace expansion in the first row.
 The minors are
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
M_{11} & =\left|\begin{array}{cc}
q & r\\
y & z\end{array}\right|=qz-ry,\\
M_{12} & =\left|\begin{array}{cc}
p & r\\
x & z\end{array}\right|=pz-rx,\\
M_{13} & =\left|\begin{array}{cc}
p & q\\
x & y\end{array}\right|=py-qx.\end{align*}

\end_inset

Hence
\begin_inset Formula \begin{align*}
\det A & =aM_{11}-bM_{12}+bM_{13}\\
 & =a(qx-ry)-b(pz-rx)+c(py-qx).\end{align*}

\end_inset

This agrees with the formula given previously.

\begin_layout Standard
A matrix with rows and columns reversed is called the

 matrix.
 For example, if
\begin_inset Formula \[
A=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
a & b & c\\
x & y & z\end{array}\right)\]

\end_inset

 is a given 
\begin_inset Formula $2\times3$
\end_inset

 matrix then the transposed matrix, denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $A^{T}$
\end_inset

, is the following 
\begin_inset Formula $3\times2$
\end_inset

 matrix:
\begin_inset Formula \[
A^{T}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}
a & x\\
b & y\\
c & z\end{array}\right).\]

\end_inset

Note that a row vector becomes a column vector when transposed, and vice
 versa.
 In general, an 
\begin_inset Formula $m\times n$

 matrix becomes an 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times m$

 matrix when transposed.

\begin_layout Standard
The scalar product of vectors, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}$
\end_inset

, can be represented as a matrix product 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}^{T}\mathbf{r}$
\end_inset

.
 For example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}=\left(a,b,c\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{r}=\left(x,y,z\right)$
\end_inset

 then 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{r}=ax+by+cz=\left[\begin{array}{ccc}
x & y & z\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
a\\
b\\
c\end{array}\right]=\mathbf{q}^{T}\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}^{T}\mathbf{q}.\]

\end_inset

A matrix product taken in the opposite order (i.e.\InsetSpace ~
a column vector times a
 row vector) gives a

 as a result, 
\begin_inset Formula \[
\mathbf{q}\mathbf{r}^{T}=\left[\begin{array}{c}

\end_inset

This is known as the

 of two vectors.
 An alternative notation is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{q}\otimes\mathbf{r}^{T}$
\end_inset

.
 Note that the result of the tensor product is not a vector but a matrix,
 i.e.\InsetSpace ~
an object of a different kind.
 (The space of 
\begin_inset Formula $n\times n$
\end_inset

 matrices is also denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbb{R}^{n}\otimes\mathbb{R}^{n}$

\begin_layout Chapter
Distribution of this text
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A scientist receives financial support from the society and the freedom
 to do research in any field.
 I believe it is a duty of scientists to make the results of their science
 freely available to the interested public in the form of understandable,
 clearly written textbooks.
 This task has been significantly alleviated by modern technology.
 Especially in theoretical sciences where no experimentally obtained photographs
 or other such significant third-party material need to be displayed, authors
 are able (if not always willing) to prepare the entire book on a personal
 computer, typing the text and drawing the diagrams using freely available
 software.
 Ubiquitous access to the Internet makes it possible to create texts of
 high typographic quality in ready-to-print form, such as a PDF file, and
 to distribute these texts essentially at no cost.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The distribution of texts in today's society is inextricably connected with
 the problem of intellectual property.
 One could simply upload PDF files to a Web site and declare these texts
 to be in public domain, so that everyone would be entitled to download
 them for free, print them, or distribute further.
 However, malicious persons might then prepare a slightly modified version
 and inhibit further distribution of the text by imposing a non-free license
 on the modified version and by threatening to sue anyone who wants to distribut
e 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 version of the text, including the old public-domain version.
 Merely a threat of a lawsuit suffices for an Internet service provider
 to take down any web page allegedly violating copyright, even if the actual
 lawsuit may be unsuccessful.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To protect the freedom of the readers, one thus needs to release the text
 under a 
\emph on
copyright
\emph default
 rather than into public domain, and at the same time one needs to make
 sure that the text, as well as any future revisions thereof, remains freely
 distributable.
 I believe that a free license, such as GNU FDL (see the next subsection),
 is an appropriate way of copyrighting a science textbook.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The present book is released under GNU FDL.
 According to the license, everyone is allowed to print this book or distribute
 it in any other way.
 In particular, any commercial publisher may offer professionally printed
 and bound copies of the book for sale; the permission to do so is 
\emph on
already
\emph default
 
\emph on
granted
\emph default
.
 Since the FDL disallows granting exclusive distribution rights, I (or anybody
 else) will not be able to sign a standard exclusive-rights contract with
 a publisher for printing this book (or any further revision of this book).
 I am happy that 
\series bold
lulu.com

 offers commercial printing of the book at low cost and at the same time
 adheres to the conditions of a free license (the GNU FDL).
